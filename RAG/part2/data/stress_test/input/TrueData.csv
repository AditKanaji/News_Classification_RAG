world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,Graft in French government has long history,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,World news,2025-10-29T17:26:47Z,"Your emphasis on the terrible harassment directed at Nathalie Gavarino, the magistrate overseeing Nicolas Sarkozy's trial, is well-founded (Editorial, 22 October). Political graft in France has deep roots: Jacques Chirac faced conviction for corrupt practices during his tenure as Paris mayor in the 1970s, while Sarkozy's own premier, François Fillon (serving 2007-2012), saw his presidential bid collapse in 2017 amid accusations of nepotistic hiring with taxpayer funds. What distinguishes Sarkozy's situation is the magnitude and brazenness of his misconduct. Beyond earning the moniker 'President Bling-Bling' for his lavish lifestyle at the Élysée Palace, his receipt of money from Muammar Gaddafi represented an unprecedented nadir for French governance. As noted, Marine Le Pen, the far-right figure most likely to assume the presidency next, herself faces an ongoing appeal concerning graft charges. While public support for Sarkozy's incarceration is encouraging, the fact he'll retain two police guards during imprisonment shows his privileged status. This unfolds as the French legislature remains gridlocked. Additional graft revelations will likely further erode faith in the political apparatus before the 2027 presidential contest. French leaders must demonstrate they can transcend this crisis to advance the nation. Dr David Lees University of Warwick • Have thoughts on anything in today's Guardian?

world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,Catherine Connolly's overwhelming win rattles Irish elite – yet politics unchanged,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,World news,2025-10-25T17:17:46Z,"Catherine Connolly's decisive triumph in Ireland's presidential race represents a remarkable political achievement that embarrasses the ruling class without indicating a nationwide leftward turn. Her victory's inevitability and scope were far from certain. Upon announcing her candidacy in July, she was essentially alone: an independent progressive parliamentarian from Galway unknown to most citizens. Nevertheless, the 68-year-old secured backing from various minor opposition groups – the Social Democrats, People Before Profit, Labour – and subsequently a major party, Sinn Féin – which opted against fielding its own contender – in an unusual display of left-wing solidarity. Even so, Connolly appeared an unlikely winner. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, the two governing center-right forces that have controlled Irish governance for a century, both nominated candidates. Given electoral procedures allowing voters to rank preferences, eliminating one candidate was anticipated to benefit the other establishment choice through transferred votes. Instead, converging circumstances transformed Connolly, whose quiet speaking voice requires listeners to move closer, into a political force. She captured 64% of ballots – a comprehensive victory across rural and urban areas and, particularly, among youth. Consequently, for seven years Ireland will have a head of state who champions equality and protecting Irish neutrality from what she characterizes as Western 'militarism' and complicity in atrocities. In Britain, some have likened Connolly to Jeremy Corbyn and express surprise – or dismay – that an EU member has shifted leftward while numerous other nations have moved rightward or far-right. However, the election defies such simplistic categorization. Undeniably, it constitutes a seismic event undermining governmental authority and credibility while strengthening prospects for a progressive coalition at the subsequent general election. Yet it doesn't signify an ideological transformation. The presidency holds largely symbolic power. Mary Robinson expanded its visibility, with Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins maintaining that trajectory, but whoever inhabits Áras an Uachtaráin, the Phoenix Park residence, faces substantial constraints. Voters twice elected Higgins – himself an outspoken progressive from Galway – while granting executive authority to successive coalitions led by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Connolly can spotlight issues, establish tone, make symbolic actions, perhaps clash with government on policy matters, but constitutional boundaries will bind her, and she's pledged to honor those limitations. External observers perceive Connolly as a Sinn Féin proxy for Irish reunification. The party's considerable resources and organizational strength supported her, yet Connolly has demonstrated minimal interest in unification and the topic barely surfaced during campaigning. She operates independently and follows her own path – as Labour, her previous party, learned when she departed and won a Dáil seat as an independent in 2016. Connolly's advocates are fervent and discuss a movement. Opposition parties, having experienced success, might potentially unite into a credible government alternative. However, two considerations should moderate breakthrough discussions. The ruling parties undermined themselves. Fianna Fáil nominated a political novice, Jim Gavin, who struggled and withdrew amid financial controversy. The belated exit meant his name stayed on ballots but party supporters had minimal motivation to vote – or, significantly, provide a backup preference to the alternative establishment candidate. Fine Gael's initial candidate, Mairead McGuinness, withdrew citing health concerns, leading the party to Jim Humphreys, counting on centrist attraction and rural authenticity; yet voters deemed her uninspiring. Despite Connolly's campaign agility, including popular videos showing her performing football tricks, opponent errors facilitated victory and the left shouldn't expect repetition. The other consideration is that most citizens abstained – turnout reached approximately 46%, reflecting widespread apathy – and unprecedented numbers deliberately invalidated their ballots, expressing dissatisfaction with candidate options. Some lamented the absence of a social conservative, others complained nobody addressed their immigration concerns. Connolly merited her landslide but not everyone celebrates."
world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,Politics manifests through other channels as Toronto Blue Jays meet LA Dodgers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,World news,2025-10-24T09:00:39Z,"Warfare, contended nineteenth-century Prussian military scholar Carl von Clausewitz, represents 'politics' continuation through alternative methods'. As Canada's largest metropolis prepares for a crucial baseball confrontation against a formidable, celebrity-filled and financially robust American rival, nationwide sentiment suggests the identical principle applies to athletics. Throughout the past year, Canada has engaged in diplomatic and economic conflict with its traditional partner, primary trade associate and, progressively, its principal adversary. On Friday, the nation's singular major league baseball franchise, the Toronto Blue Jays, will compete against the Los Angeles Dodgers in a matchup Canadians interpret as both demonstrating its rising baseball prowess and expressing national dignity. Across the past year, international athletics have acquired fresh significance in Canada following Donald Trump's threats to absorb the country and convert it into America's '51st state'. During peak provocations, Canada defeated the US at the Four Nations ice hockey competition, where supporters jeered each nation's anthem in an unusual breach of etiquette revealing the situation's intensity. Following Canada's overtime victory, former premier Justin Trudeau encapsulated the national sentiment in a social media message: 'You cannot claim our nation – and you cannot claim our sport.' Friday's contest, held in Toronto, follows the Blue Jays' elimination of the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners to advance to the World Series. It also represents the initial high-stakes professional athletic championship between the two nations since last year's hockey encounter. Bilateral tensions have diminished recently as premier Mark Carney pursues a trade agreement with his erratic counterpart, yet numerous ordinary Canadians continue boycotting the US and American products. During Carney's Oval Office visit this month, Trump addressed a significant decrease in cross-border American visits, responding: 'Canadian citizens will embrace us again.' Carney seized the chance to boast about the ascending Blue Jays, cautioning the president: 'We're arriving for the World Series, Mr President.' Earlier this week, Carney informed reporters he felt 'extremely excited' about the Blue Jays following their dramatic and statistically improbable victory over the Seattle Mariners – a triumph sending the team to the World Series for the first occasion in over thirty years. The match, concluded with a home run, produced what many regard as among the franchise's greatest moments and has generated popular clips, including one merging Canadian vocalist Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On with the crowd's jubilant home run reaction. Observing batting practice before the opening game, Carney mentioned Trump was 'reluctant' to wager on the series. 'He dislikes defeat. He hasn't contacted. He hasn't responded to my call regarding the wager so I'm prepared. We're prepared to establish a wager with the US.' Unlike ice hockey, featuring seven professional Canadian franchises, the Blue Jays constitute the sole major league baseball team commanding a nationwide fanbase. Despite baseball's tremendous American popularity, the Blue Jays' miraculous postseason journey reflects the frequently overlooked profound Canadian baseball heritage. Early professional teams originated in southern Ontario. Babe Ruth, the iconic slugger, achieved his inaugural home run while in Toronto. Jackie Robinson overcame the racial divide playing for a Montreal franchise before joining the Brooklyn Dodgers. 'Hockey unites Canadians, yet baseball does likewise. Canada proves fundamentally essential to contemporary Major League Baseball. We've contributed to developing this sport. In numerous respects, we're the co-creators,' stated Liam Mooney, whose 'Canada is Not For Sale' caps became a popular phenomenon earlier this year. 'Perhaps we're excessively modest about our contributions. Yet we shouldn't hesitate claiming recognition for our achievements.' Mooney, operating a design company in Ottawa with his partner Emma Cochrane, created the caps both as a response to the red 'Make America Great Again' headwear worn and marketed by Donald Trump and as 'a modest patriotic gesture addressing these significant threats and considerable bluster'. Mooney's caps gained popularity nationwide, transcending political and geographic boundaries, an accomplishment perhaps matched solely by the Blue Jays. In Canada, a favored pastime for non-Torontonians involves ridiculing the nation's largest city. However, its baseball team receives uncommon exemption, with the team's emblem commonly visible across the country. 'The Blue Jays previously united the nation, surpassing any other franchise,' he remarked, noting they maintain a flawless World Series record following victories in their 1992 and 1993 appearances. 'They've generated narratives and recollections in citizens' lives. And they'll accomplish this again.' American media have portrayed the Jays as the underdogs in the best-of-seven contest, though some have characterized the battle as 'Goliath versus Goliath'. The Dodgers have invested substantial funds signing prominent players. Their USD$509.5m, including taxes, doubles the Blue Jays' $252.7m and reflects the economic disparity between the two nations. Friday's opening match represents the 23rd occasion the Dodgers have reached the baseball world series. Yet for Canada's team, the delayed appearance carries deeper meaning. 'We're a hockey nation. We're a lacrosse nation. Yet baseball has proven fundamental to the Canadian experience,' stated Mooney. 'And if it's 'America's pastime'? Well, this year we're certainly challenging for it.' • This article received amendments on 27 October 2025 because there are seven professional Canadian ice hockey teams, not six as previously stated."
world/2025/nov/04/judges-doing-politics-can-spanish-pm-survive-corruption-cases-against-family-and-allies,'Magistrates engaging in politics': can Spanish PM withstand graft allegations against relatives and associates?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/04/judges-doing-politics-can-spanish-pm-survive-corruption-cases-against-family-and-allies,World news,2025-11-04T05:00:19Z,"Despite dedicating the previous 18 months variably defending his spouse, his sibling, his party, his attorney general and his administration against an unrelenting barrage of graft accusations, Spain's socialist premier, Pedro Sánchez, hasn't completely abandoned his wit. Three weeks prior, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the opposition conservative People's party (PP) leader, recited the familiar catalog of charges and concluded by suggesting the individual facing him in parliament was neither 'a respectable or worthy premier' but rather an experienced corruption facilitator. Following the enthusiastic applause that welcomed Feijóo's address from the PP seats had subsided, Sánchez stood and spoke two words. 'Ánimo, Alberto,' he stated. 'Stay strong, Alberto.' The premier's comeback appeared deliberately selected to remind Feijóo's party of its own difficulties. Seven years earlier, Sánchez assumed the premiership by employing a no-confidence motion to remove the PP administration of one of Feijóo's predecessors, Mariano Rajoy. By that point, the conservative party was so entangled in controversies that Sánchez accused it of converting Spanish governance into a 'graft thriller'. In leaked text communications, Rajoy instructed his close colleague, former PP treasurer Luis Bárcenas, to 'remain resilient' and maintain spirits as investigations intensified – hence the 'Ánimo, Alberto' jab. In May 2018, Bárcenas received 33 years imprisonment for fraud and money laundering, and the PP itself was determined to have benefited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts operation. A week subsequently, the PP departed government and Sánchez became Spain's new premier. Considering what befell Rajoy and his administration, some might view Sánchez's provocation as tempting destiny. However, the premier has maintained he has worked to address graft and remains convinced the proceedings against his relatives are politically driven vendettas conducted by his right and far-right adversaries and their media allies. More controversially, he has also questioned some Spanish judiciary members' independence, asserting in early September 'there's no question that certain magistrates engage in politics and certain politicians attempt to administer justice'. That accusation faced testing on Monday, when Spain's attorney general, Álvaro García Ortiz, appeared at the supreme court for trial on alleged confidential information disclosure charges. García Ortiz – who informed the court he wasn't guilty of the allegations he faces – stands accused of leaking case details concerning Alberto González Amador, a businessman under investigation for alleged tax evasion, to a media outlet. González Amador is the partner of the populist PP regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who ranks among Sánchez's most vocal and unrestrained critics. The two-week trial will hear from 40 witnesses, including prosecutors, press officials, journalists, police personnel, politicians, attorneys and Amador himself. While the landmark proceedings represent the initial instance of a serving Spanish attorney general facing trial, by far the most attention-grabbing allegations surrounding Sánchez's governance have concerned his spouse. At late April last year, the premier astonished Spain by announcing he was temporarily suspending his public responsibilities and contemplating his political future after a court initiated an investigation into Begoña Gómez for alleged influence-peddling and graft. The investigation originated from a complaint by Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-described trade union with far-right connections that has extensively used courts to pursue those it considers threatening to Spain's democratic interests. Gómez has been accused of exploiting her position as the premier's spouse to obtain sponsors for a university master's program she directed and of utilizing state resources to compensate her assistant for personal assistance. Sánchez's younger sibling, David, also faces investigation over alleged influence-peddling allegations. According to another Manos Limpias complaint, David Sánchez received a customized position from the socialist-led council of the southwestern city of Badajoz in July 2017, when his brother led the Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) nationally. Gómez and David Sánchez have rejected any misconduct. The premier – who has stated his relatives have been victims of a 'harassment and intimidation operation' – has maintained that neither has committed any violation. 'The truth will emerge eventually,' he stated in September. 'My sibling and my spouse are innocent.' However, additional judicial challenges exist. In June, Sánchez directed Santos Cerdán, the PSOE's organizational secretary and his principal deputy, to resign after a supreme court magistrate discovered 'substantial evidence' of his potential participation in accepting kickbacks on public construction agreements. His case connects to those of two other individuals, former transport minister José Luis Ábalos – who preceded Cerdán as the PSOE's organizational secretary – and Ábalos's former assistant Koldo García. Ábalos was dismissed from Sánchez's cabinet in 2021 and suspended by the PSOE in February last year after declining to resign when García was accused of accepting bribes to expedite mask agreements during the Covid crisis. Both individuals have rejected any misconduct. The Cerdán investigation arrived as a severe setback to Sánchez, who appeared unusually disturbed during a hastily organized press conference where he apologized to Spanish citizens and PSOE supporters – but excluded a snap general election. 'We responded decisively and now judicial authorities will determine Mr Cerdán's culpability,' he stated at the time. The premier demonstrated more combative form when summoned to testify before the senate last Thursday over the so-called 'Koldo case'. After dismissing the committee investigating the matter as a 'spectacle' and a 'defamation committee', Sánchez maintained the PSOE's finances were 'completely clean', adding there was no 'systematic graft' in his administration – unlike in its PP predecessors. If the premier's opponents are accustomed to Spanish political discourse's bluntness and excesses, numerous country magistrates have not appreciated the doubts he has expressed about their impartiality. Alejandro González Mariscal de Gante, a representative for the largest professional magistrates' association, the conservative Asociación Profesional de la Magistratura, dismissed the suggestion that Spanish justice had succumbed to 'lawfare', stating its magistrates were independent professionals who frequently found themselves entangled in party politics. 'If we investigate, we're problematic and engage in politics,' he stated. 'Yet if we don't investigate, and we dismiss cases or acquit, we're acceptable … But we're not influenced by political standards. We investigate independently and we adjudicate independently – and it's beneficial we continue functioning despite all the political questions and despite who governs. That's appropriate.' Others have demonstrated greater circumspection. The day following Sánchez accusing a minority of magistrates of engaging in politics, the progressive Judges for Democracy (JJpD) association stated that, while such declarations perhaps shouldn't originate from the premier, there was no question that 'certain judicial proceedings' were being utilized for clearly partisan purposes. 'For some time, our association has been condemning politics' judicialization – and that's why we urge courts to function as energetically as feasible to prevent it,' stated JJpD representative Edmundo Rodríguez. Despite the extensive judicial complications threatening to overwhelm the legacy of one of Europe's few remaining socialist leaders, Sánchez maintains his concentration remains on governing – even if that may prove easier stated than accomplished. His minority coalition administration will struggle to advance legislation after the Catalan separatist party Junts, which assisted Sánchez back into office in exchange for a controversial amnesty law, announced it would terminate its administration support because it has failed to fulfill the agreement reached two years earlier. Bleak though the prospects may appear, the great survivor of Spanish governance may derive comfort from a recent survey suggesting the PSOE could be recovering from its summer of controversy and difficulty. The poll, from Spain's state Sociological Research Centre, positioned the socialists first with 34.8% – 15 percentage points ahead of the PP. Such a margin, unseen for six years, may encourage hopes in Sánchez's circle that PSOE voters are consolidating behind the party confronting what they perceive as a series of politically motivated court proceedings. Much, however, will depend on what reaches court – and what emerges in court – across the approaching weeks and months. Meanwhile, Sánchez is, as typical, attempting to persevere. 'Naturally these graft controversies were extremely difficult for us to accept, yet the political endeavor is broader,' he stated at early September. 'And I believe the most significant message that I'd wish to communicate to my citizens is that the national direction that we initiated seven years earlier is the appropriate one, and it's not an abstract one.'"
world/2025/oct/06/sebastien-lecornu-france-pm-resigns-explainer,What transpired on a turbulent day in French governance – and what follows?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/06/sebastien-lecornu-france-pm-resigns-explainer,World news,2025-10-06T17:45:52Z,"Even by contemporary standards, Monday constituted a day of considerable turmoil in France's governmental corridors. In the morning, hours following his new cabinet announcement and under a month since his appointment, the premier, Sébastien Lecornu, resigned alongside his administration. Subsequently, late afternoon, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, stated he had requested the departing premier to remain for two additional days in a final attempt to navigate the country's rapidly intensifying political crisis. It represented the latest shocking development in a sequence of events suggesting France, the EU's second most populous member nation, is becoming progressively difficult to govern. Here is an examination of what just occurred, why – and what could follow. What just occurred? Lecornu, who was appointed 27 days previously, submitted his resignation and that of his administration on Monday, barely 12 hours following the announcement of his cabinet's key members. He became the briefest-tenured premier in modern French history. The 39-year-old former defence minister, a close Macron ally, was France's fifth premier since the president's re-election in 2022 and the third since Macron dissolved parliament and summoned early legislative elections held last summer. Lecornu blamed party-political inflexibility, stating he had been 'prepared to compromise, yet every party desired every other party to embrace its complete program'. It would 'not require much for it to function', yet 'partisan approaches' and 'particular egos' obstructed progress, he stated. His departure alarmed markets, with the CAC 40 stock index declining 2% and the euro 0.7%. France's debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU's third-highest following Greece and Italy, nearly double the 60% allowed under EU regulations – as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%. Following a meeting with Macron at the Élysée, Lecornu stated he had consented to the president's request for one final negotiation effort. He would inform Macron by Wednesday evening 'whether this is feasible or not', he stated. Why did it occur? The crisis's origins lie in that 2024 snap general election, which produced a deadlocked parliament divided between three approximately equal factions: the left, the far right and Macron's own center-right coalition, with no group approaching a clear majority. France's financial crisis has only intensified that instability, as have presidential elections scheduled for 2027. Macron cannot stand again, and with each party eager to establish its position before the vote, common ground in parliament has become even more elusive. Lecornu faced the challenging task of advancing an austerity budget through the divided assembly aimed at controlling the massive budget deficit – a task that defeated his two immediate predecessors, François Bayrou and Michel Barnier, who were removed by MPs over the plan. The immediate catalyst for his resignation appears to have been the center-right Les Républicains (LR) reaction to the new cabinet. The party stated the largely unchanged configuration did not reflect the 'substantial departure' from past governance that Lecornu had promised. However, the announcement of the principal cabinet positions on Sunday evening prompted intense criticism from across the political spectrum, with allies and opponents condemning it as either excessively right wing or insufficiently right wing, and threatening to remove the new administration. The return of Bruno Le Maire, Macron's economy minister for seven years, to government as defence minister particularly enraged politicians from most parties, who interpreted it as a confirmation that Macron's pro-business economic policies were non-negotiable. His return, however, proved as brief as it was controversial: on Monday evening Le Maire stated he was withdrawing from the government in an attempt to resolve the crisis. What could occur next? Government sources informed French media that Macron would 'accept his responsibilities' if the effort to achieve a final consensus by Wednesday failed. It was not immediately evident what this may involve. Should that effort fail, Macron has three principal options, none particularly attractive. First, he could designate a new premier. A figure from within his own camp now appears unlikely, while even a moderate progressive would challenge his hard-won pension reforms. Conversely, appointing a confirmed conservative would infuriate the left faction. Given the pressing need to achieve minimal consensus to at least advance a budget for this year, some analysts have suggested he may attempt to turn to a non-party political technocrat. Second, he could dissolve the national assembly and summon fresh legislative elections, a move he has consistently stated he is reluctant to pursue and which polls suggest would probably return another divided parliament – or potentially introduce a far-right administration. The anti-immigrant National Rally of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have made clear this is their preferred option, calling on Macron to dissolve parliament and conduct fresh elections. His final option would be to resign, but again, he has repeatedly excluded stepping aside before the presidential election in 2027 – a vote perceived as a historic juncture in French governance, with Le Pen sensing her best ever opportunity of assuming power. The radical left France Unbowed has reiterated longstanding demands for the president to depart."
world/2025/sep/10/new-french-pm-sebastien-lecornu-promises-profound-break-with-past-politics,New French PM Sébastien Lecornu pledges 'substantial departure' from previous governance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/new-french-pm-sebastien-lecornu-promises-profound-break-with-past-politics,World news,2025-09-10T17:49:11Z,"The new French premier, Sébastien Lecornu, has pledged a 'substantial departure' from previous governance as he assumed control from the unpopular centrist François Bayrou, who was removed this week over a proposed budget reduction. Lecornu, 39, who stated 'humility' was the essential approach, now faces the challenging task of securing sufficient support from France's divided parliament to advance a budget if he is to avoid being swiftly removed in the same manner as Bayrou, and before him, the conservative Michel Barnier, who only survived three months. 'We will succeed … no path is unattainable,' Lecornu stated on Wednesday. Lecornu is the third French premier in only one year as the country has experienced a period of instability and political crisis since the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, summoned an inconclusive snap election last year. The parliament remains divided between the three factions: the left, the far right and the center, with no clear majority. A budget for next year must be agreed within the coming weeks, even though the political parties are at an impasse. Lecornu, who as defence minister for the past three years was recognized for his work on increasing French military expenditure, stated: 'We are going to have to transform, be more innovative and rigorous in our approach to working with the opposition.' He stated there must be profound changes to working methods, but also to the substance of governance. Lecornu stated he would address France 'in the coming days' to explain his approach, which he pledged would differ from the past. He is expected to take several weeks to establish a new administration. The new premier began meeting party leaders as tens of thousands of protesters held a national day of demonstrations on Wednesday, blocking roads and gathering in town centers as 80,000 police were deployed across France. Lecornu is perceived as representing continuity rather than transformation. He had a background on the right in Nicolas Sarkozy's party before joining Macron's centrists eight years ago. He is regarded as one of Macron's most loyal allies, having been in government since Macron was first elected in 2017. Lecornu is so close to Macron that he has been characterized as 'Macron's spiritual successor'. Opposition parties, which had desired a radical change of direction from a new premier, cautioned on Wednesday that they remained highly critical and a wrong step could lead to Lecornu being removed in a no-confidence vote. Gaël Sliman of the pollsters Odoxa informed France 5 TV that snap polling on Lecornu's appointment showed he had the lowest ratings of any new premier in recent years. Boris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist parliament group, stated: 'He was part of an administration that was removed this week. You can appreciate our skepticism. What French people are requesting is a change of governance.' The progressive party La France Insoumise announced an immediate no-confidence motion against Lecornu in parliament, but for now without backing from other parties. Lecornu's challenge is to at least convince a majority of opposition parties to refrain from removing him in a no-confidence vote. Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally party stated Lecornu was 'in a very precarious position'. He stated unless there was proof of a genuine change in governance, there would be a no-confidence motion and Lecornu would 'collapse'. Bardella stated: 'I fear that Macron has once again made a choice of instability.' Sébastien Chenu, the vice-president of Le Pen's party, stated it would be 'very surprising' if Lecornu, a Macron ally, 'departed from Macron's governance'."
world/2025/oct/04/the-fear-was-immense-al-shabaab-exploits-fragmented-politics-to-reclaim-land-in-somalia,'The terror was overwhelming': al-Shabaab capitalizes on divided governance to recover territory in Somalia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/the-fear-was-immense-al-shabaab-exploits-fragmented-politics-to-reclaim-land-in-somalia,World news,2025-10-04T12:00:07Z,"One night in early July, Maryan Abdikadir Geedi decided it was finally time to abandon her small shop in the town of Moqokori in the Hiiraan region of Somalia. Though she had heard of the rapid recent gains made by al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant movement, the 46-year-old had hoped to remain. Since marrying in 2013, Geedi had witnessed control over Moqokori shift hands repeatedly. 'Just as rainfall arrives and departs, so does control over Moqokori, but this occasion was different,' Geedi stated. Since initiating their offensive in February, al-Shabaab has advanced through a substantial portion of Somalia, recovering all the territory it lost to a coalition of government forces and allied tribal militias supported by US and Turkish air power in 2023, and acquiring more. In July, the fighting had reached within 40km (25 miles) of Mogadishu, the capital. Some observers anticipated the capital might fall. 'The terror was overwhelming. Information began circulating that [al-Shabaab] were advancing. When the terror became unbearable, I decided to depart,' stated Geedi, who headed for the town of Buloburde, 90km away, with her husband and nine children. In recent weeks, battle lines have stabilized, though government security forces remain on the defensive. There is a construction surge in Mogadishu, and few now believe the capital will be seized by the militants. Though the US has intensified airstrikes against al-Shabaab and other militant groups in Somalia, Washington has indicated it will not redeploy the hundreds of special forces withdrawn during Donald Trump's first term. Instead, countries such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda have committed troops, training or air support over recent years, while the African Union mission continues to deploy thousands of soldiers. Egypt is now contributing a large contingent too. Without this support, government forces would collapse, analysts state. 'It's a strategic deadlock,' stated Samira Gaid, regional security analyst with Balqiis, a Mogadishu-based research organization. 'Al-Shabaab are not interested in capturing Mogadishu. They have numerous smaller towns under their control and most of the rural areas. We have been stuck here for a while … and we will be stuck with it for as long as the government has the advantage provided by foreign troops.' The success of the recent al-Shabaab offensive has dealt a significant blow to the morale of fragmented security forces and the government of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who pledged 'complete war' against the militants after assuming power in 2022. 'I've lost 20 friends [fellow soldiers] and have been wounded twice in battle,' stated one 42-year-old Somalia National Army veteran in the city of Beledweyne. 'I've fought in Beera Yabaal, Aboorey, Yasooman, Mabaax, Ceel Qooxle, Adan Yabaal, Masjid Cali Gaduud and Daaru Nicma. In the time since, all these areas have been recaptured by al-Shabaab,' he stated. '[Al-Shabaab fighters] believe if they perish, paradise awaits them, while most soldiers … want to collect their minimal salaries and return to their families.' The veteran stated he was concerned by the rapid gains made by al-Shabaab in recent months but fears worse is approaching if nothing is done now to halt the militant advance. 'Now [al-Shabaab] are in a position where they can move fighters and supplies [around the country] as result of capturing strategic towns in Hiiraan. This puts many more areas in south and central Somalia at risk of falling. They are moving rapidly,' he stated. Observers point to the government's weakness as the main cause of the militants' recent success. 'The situation with al-Shabaab on the ground is always determined by the overall political and security environment and that is quite problematic at the moment,' stated Ahmed Soliman, an expert in east Africa at Chatham House in London. 'There are really significant divisions in the country and these make it very difficult for federal government, its forces and international forces to coordinate counter terrorist efforts. Al-Shabaab are exploiting a very fragmented political landscape at this time.' Further funding for the $160m annually African Union force in Somalia is also uncertain, which 'has an impact on operations', Soliman stated. Three weeks following the fall of Moqokori, al-Shabaab seized the strategic town of Maxaas, which sent shock waves across the country. 'With each day that passed more people began departing. Homes had been abandoned, stores and markets left vacant,' stated Nimo Abdi Barre, 37. With her husband and six children, Nimo trekked to the town's outskirts, where they were able to hitchhike on a lorry heading towards the city of Beledweyne – the capital of Hirshabelle province. 'My children were vomiting and screaming. This was intensified by fears of IEDs and landmines on the road. My faith in God is what sustained me through,' she stated. Nimo has remained in Beledweyne, which the government has thus far successfully defended. 'I'm here with family but simultaneously nothing is worse than feeling like a refugee on your own territory,' she stated. 'I want to return home but only time will reveal if I ever receive the opportunity.'"
world/2025/apr/21/political-and-religious-leaders-world-pay-tribute-to-pope-francis,Political and religious leaders globally honor Pope Francis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/political-and-religious-leaders-world-pay-tribute-to-pope-francis,World news,2025-04-21T14:00:06Z,"Political and religious leaders globally have honored the life and legacy of Pope Francis, whose 12-year papacy concluded with his death in Rome early on Monday morning at the age of 88. Many recalled his steadfast defense of the poorest and most marginalized, and his profound commitment to peace and the environment. They also remembered his warmth and wit as an individual and as leader of the world's 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, characterized Francis as 'a messenger of hope, humility and humanity' and 'a transcendent voice for peace, human dignity and social justice'. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, stated the late pope had consistently sided with the most vulnerable – and had done so with considerable humility. 'In this era of conflict and brutality, he possessed sensitivity for others, for the most fragile,' Macron informed reporters on a visit to the French territory of Mayotte, adding that 'great sorrow' would be felt at the pontiff's death in France and internationally. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, stated news of Francis's death was cause for great sadness because it marked the departure of 'a great individual [and] a great shepherd'. In a statement, she added: 'I had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, his counsel, his teachings, which never ceased not even during times of trial and suffering. We bid farewell to the Holy Father with a heart full of sadness.' Spain's premier, Pedro Sánchez, stated Francis's 'commitment to peace, social justice and the most vulnerable leaves a profound legacy', while King Felipe praised the pope for bringing 'consolation to the poorest'. Ireland's president, Michael Higgins, stated Francis's recognition of the 'essential dignity' of every human being had helped him confront issues such as the climate crisis and the plight of immigrants, as well as the child sexual abuse scandal that has shocked the church. Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, stated Francis had been guided by 'humility and simplicity' throughout his lengthy pastoral ministry: 'He selected as his papal motto the words of his episcopal calling: 'Miserando atque eligendo' – 'He looked upon him with mercy and chose him.' He was a great apostle of mercy, in which he saw an answer to the challenges of the modern world.' The premier of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, stated Francis's 'modest way of life [and] acts of service and compassion' had made him a role model to many Catholics and non-Catholics alike. 'The global Catholic community bids farewell to a leader who acknowledged the pressing issues of our day and called attention to them,' he added. Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stated with the death of Pope Francis, 'the Catholic church and the world lose an advocate for the vulnerable, a reconciling and a warm-hearted individual'. The country's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, stated the world had 'lost a brilliant beacon of hope', adding: 'From the very first days of his ministry as bishop of Rome, he made it clear that the poor and marginalized, the displaced and refugees could be sure of his special attention, his special care and even his special affection. Many who felt forgotten felt heard, seen and understood by him, the pope.' The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, offered his condolences to Christians in Israel and across the world. 'He appropriately saw great importance in fostering strong ties with the Jewish world and in advancing interfaith dialogue as a path towards greater understanding and mutual respect,' Herzog stated. Although Israel's relationship with Francis had become strained over the past 18 months because of the late pontiff's calls to end the conflict in Gaza, Herzog added: 'I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered.' The New Zealand premier, Christopher Luxon, remembered Francis as 'an individual of humility' who had left behind a legacy that included 'an unwavering commitment to the vulnerable, to social justice and to interfaith dialogue'. The US president, Donald Trump – whose policies on immigration and mass deportation were openly criticized by the late pontiff – issued a brief post on his Truth Social platform, stating: 'Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!' Joe Biden, who was only the second Roman Catholic to serve as US president, hailed the late pope as 'unlike any who came before him', adding: 'Pope Francis will be remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time and I am better for having known him.' The US vice-president, JD Vance – who held a brief meeting with Francis in Rome on Sunday morning – stated his heart went out to the millions of Catholics globally who had loved the pontiff. 'I was pleased to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of Covid. It was really quite beautiful.' Javier Milei, the president of Francis's native Argentina, voiced 'profound sorrow' over the death of the first Latin American pontiff. The conservative radical was a longtime critic of Francis, whom he notoriously characterized as a communism-promoting imbecile and even 'a son of a bitch'. However, the two individuals were reconciled last year during a brief meeting when Milei visited the Vatican. On Monday, Milei stated: 'Despite the differences that seem minor today, being able to meet him and witness his goodness and wisdom was a true honor for me.' Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, stated that with the pope's passing, humanity had lost 'a voice of respect and acceptance of others'. He stated Francis had illuminated the issue of the climate crisis and 'vigorously criticized' the economic models that had caused so much injustice. The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stated Francis 'understood how to provide hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity'. He added: 'He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!' Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, stated Francis had won international renown as 'a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious and statesmanlike figure, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice'. India's premier, Narendra Modi, described the pope as 'a beacon of compassion', while Egypt's president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, called Francis a 'voice of peace, love and compassion'. Keir Starmer, the UK premier, stated Francis had been 'a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten. He was close to the realities of human fragility, meeting Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty. Yet he never lost hope of a better world.' Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York and interim leader of the Church of England, paid tribute to a 'holy individual of God' who was deeply committed to the poor and to the environment. 'I recall, in the brief occasions spent with him, how this holy individual of God was also very human,' Cottrell added. 'He was witty, lively, pleasant to be with, and the warmth of his personality and interest in others radiated from him.' The former archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who became the leader of the world's Anglicans in same year that Francis was elected pope, stated: 'From the very first days of his papacy he was an example of humility. He constantly reminded us of the importance of serving the poor, always standing with those who faced persecution and hardship.' Pinchas Goldschmidt, the president of the Conference of European Rabbis, also offered his condolences and recalled what he termed Francis's 'unwavering dedication to promoting peace and goodwill worldwide'. Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, offered Buddhist prayers and wrote to the papal envoy to 'express his sadness' at Francis's death. 'Pope Francis dedicated himself to the service of others … consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life,' the Buddhist leader stated in a statement from his base in exile in India. 'The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warm-hearted individual, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.' Countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Spain declared periods of national mourning, while in Italy, all Serie A football matches scheduled for Easter Monday were postponed."
us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,Surveys and governance indicate a transformation in US perspectives on Israel. Will it have significance?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,World news,2025-10-08T13:00:33Z,"They appeared to be the bonds that would eternally bind. For three-quarters of a century, unwavering support for Israel – in the form of military aid and diplomatic backing, and underpinned by broad public sentiment – has been an indelible feature of the US political landscape. But Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate in Michigan, tipped by some as a rising star, detected something had changed as he campaigned in 58 towns and cities across what has long been one of the country's election swing states. 'There's no question that there's been a transformation,' he stated. 'We've now experienced genocide, and that is bound to alter public opinion in a pretty profound manner.' Two years following Hamas's assault on 7 October 2023 that killed almost 1,200 – mostly civilians – on the Israeli side and which initially generated a surge in popular solidarity, the perspectives of the American public have indeed undergone a remarkable transformation, surveys and analysts state. Fueled by mounting dissent over the Gaza conflict, which has left more than 67,000 Palestinians deceased and produced harrowing images of widespread starvation, popular support for Israel has declined to previously unprecedented levels – while sympathy for the Palestinian cause has risen. The effect was apparent in Michigan this week when Mallory McMorrow, one of El-Sayed's Democratic opponents in a three-way party primary to replace the retiring senator Gary Peters, publicly agreed with El-Sayed's characterization of the conflict as 'genocide'. Politicians – Democratic and Republican – who would once have refrained from voicing the mildest criticism of Israel, now openly condemn the prolonged Gaza offensive, a small but growing number calling it a genocide. This public expression has done nothing to ease the Palestinians' plight, or interrupt the billions of dollars of US military aid flowing to Israel; several election cycles may be needed for the policy impact to emerge. Yet analysts believe the change in public opinion to be so fundamental as to represent a permanent shift. Significantly, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) – for years the most influential pro-Israel lobby group, which has organized primary challenges and boasted of unseating members of Congress deemed too critical or unsupportive – has shown signs of diminishing influence, as senior Democrats reportedly sever longstanding ties. The seismic shift is even more pronounced among the wider public. A Pew Research Center survey last week reported that nearly six out of 10 Americans, 59%, now hold an unfavorable view of Israel, while 39% believe it is 'going too far' in its Gaza conflict – compared with 31% who held the same view a year ago, and 27% who thought this just two months after the conflict started. A survey from the same organization in 2022 showed 42% with unfavorable views. The anti-Israel swing is confirmed by other surveys. A recent New York Times/Siena survey showed pro-Palestinians sympathies outscoring support for Israel – albeit narrowly, by 35% to 34%. An Economist/You Gov survey in August found that 45% of the public believe Israel is committing genocide – a charge Israel vociferously denies – compared with only 31% who disagreed. About four in 10 American Jews believe the same, according to a new Washington Post survey. The change has been more acute among Democrats, where support for Israel is declining among all voter groups – with potentially profound implications for future elections and US foreign policy. 'A debate is developing among Democrats that is certain to appear in the Democratic presidential primaries, and it will not be a comfortable debate within the party,' stated Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a recent report on Israel's eroding support. 'If the next president is a Democrat, there will be a mix of views represented in the White House, and that itself will have an impact on governance,' he continued. The shift has propelled upstart candidates who have publicly identified themselves with the Palestinian cause. The most notable has been Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who triumphed in a Democratic primary to become the party's candidate for New York mayor after championing Palestinian rights. Another is El-Sayed, in his campaign to be the party's Senate candidate in Michigan, a traditional election swing state and home to a significant bloc of Arab American voters who swung in significant numbers to support Donald Trump in last November's presidential election because of disenchantment with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's support for Israel's Gaza offensive. El-Sayed, a former public health official, stated his campaign had revealed an altered view of the conflict irrespective of background. 'I've visited numerous communities where there are no Arab or Muslim residents and when I when I discuss this issue, there's a collective relief,' he stated in an interview. 'People think, 'Finally there's a politician who's willing to name the obvious … our tax dollars are being sent abroad to accomplish unspeakable things instead of investing here at home.' 'Over the past few years, we've watched as life has become more unaffordable. People are struggling to afford everything from groceries to gas to healthcare, watching their schools crumble. 'So the concept that our tax dollars that could be used to invest in our children here at home are instead being used to destroy other children is beyond acceptable for a lot of folks.' 'The final extremely Zionist-inclined administration' Republicans are encountering their own version of skepticism over support for Israel. While voters over 50, according to the Brookings study, remain staunchly supportive of Israel, a drift has been discernible among younger Republicans, many of whom see unconditional backing for Israel as clashing with Donald Trump's commitments to avoid foreign entanglements. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right member of Congress from Georgia, made headlines in July by labeling Israel's actions in Gaza 'genocide', several weeks before Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont, did the same. Trump has taken note. Talking to the Daily Caller in September, the president – who last week unveiled a plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, standing alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – stated Israel had lost political influence in Washington. 'Israel was the strongest lobby I've ever seen. They had total control over Congress, and now they don't,' he stated. Growing restiveness among his Maga base may have spurred Trump into trying to end the conflict with greater urgency, although the results remain to be seen. Some supporters state the disenchantment is generational. Curtis Mills, executive director of the American Conservative, a magazine originally founded to oppose the US-led invasion of Iraq, and which has long railed against the US alliance with Israel, stated Trump's presidency could be 'the final baby boomer, conservative, extremely Zionist-inclined administration'. 'The US has been involved in foreign policy ventures at the behest of the Israeli cause for decades, and it hasn't worked for the United States – it's worked for Benjamin Netanyahu,' he stated. 'For people under 40, 30, or even 20, when it's the Middle East, again, again, again, the gag reflex is activating fully. And I think it's becoming bipartisan.' He continued: 'The average age of a congressman is in the mid-60s, so this is not going to be expressed in legislative power today or even in the next Congress. But for under-50s, I think the Israel issue is dead on arrival. 'It is unlikely that the [next] Republican [presidential] candidate will be nearly as pro-Israel as previous Republican candidates have been.' For now, the clearest signs of a transformation may be in Washington, where Aipac – long the dominant pro-Israel lobby group – is losing ground to traditionally smaller organizations. The New York Times reported that Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, had accepted the endorsement of J Street, a center-left group that has criticized Netanyahu's government and favors a two-state solution to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. 'For a prolonged period, Aipac was the dominant force,' stated Galston, of the Brookings Institution. 'It will be a more equal competition in the next cycle.' Marshall Wittmann, Aipac's spokesman, cited a Senate vote in July defeating a motion backed by Sanders seeking to halt US arms sales to Israel as proof that Congress remains pro-Israel. While senators voted against the resolution to block the sale of assault rifles, a majority of Democrats present in the chamber, voted in favor. 'Surveys fluctuate, but the reality is that Israel is fighting a just and moral conflict against a barbaric enemy that savagely attacked the Jewish state on October 7 and continues to hold 48 hostages,' he wrote in an email. 'It is entirely consistent with American interests and values to stand with a democratic ally as it battles Hamas and other Iranian terrorist proxies.' However, Galston anticipated that future policymakers would not perceive Israel in same David-and-Goliath image that once shaped the US view. 'Joe Biden will surely be the last [Democratic] president whose perspectives were shaped by the early years of Israel, its astonishing victory in 1967 [in the six-day conflict], and by the fact that Israel was a beleaguered underdog for decades,' he stated. 'That has all changed.'"
