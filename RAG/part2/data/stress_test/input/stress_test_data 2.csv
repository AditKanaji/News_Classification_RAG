world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,Political Graft Has a Long History in France,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,World news,2025-10-29T17:26:47Z,"It is appropriate to draw attention to the terrible harassment directed at Nathalie Gavarino, the magistrate who oversaw Nicolas Sarkozy's legal proceedings (Editorial, Oct 22). Malfeasance within the French political sphere is hardly a novel phenomenon: Jacques Chirac was found guilty of graft from his time as Paris mayor in the 70s, and Sarkozy's own premier, François Fillon, witnessed his presidential bid collapse in 2017 due to claims of using state funds to pay family members. However, the magnitude and brazenness of Sarkozy's actions distinguish his situation. Not only was he dubbed 'President Bling-Bling' for his flashy lifestyle, but taking money from Muammar Gaddafi marked a new depth. As noted, Marine Le Pen, a top contender for the presidency, is also awaiting an appeal decision regarding corruption. While it is encouraging to see support for his incarceration, his special treatment in jail shows he is no regular inmate. This occurs as the French assembly faces a deadlock. More graft cases could further weaken the political system before the 2027 election. Leaders must rise above this to advance the nation."

Her victory, and particularly its magnitude, was far from certain. Back in July, when she announced her run, she was essentially a solo operator: an independent left-leaning parliamentarian from Galway unknown to many. However, the 68-year-old secured support from a mix of minor opposition groups and tapped into a widespread desire for change."

As Toronto prepares for a crucial baseball series against a wealthy, star-studded American team, many across Canada feel that sports now reflect this sentiment. Over the past year, Canada has been involved in diplomatic and economic tensions with its traditional ally and largest trading partner."

Recently, opposition leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo listed the usual charges and implied that Sánchez was more of a defendant than a leader. The pressure remains intense as legal challenges mount against his close allies."

Early in the day, shortly following the unveiling of his new ministry team and under a month into his tenure, Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu stepped down along with his cabinet. Later that afternoon, President Emmanuel Macron requested the departing premier to remain in post for an additional 48 hours in a desperate attempt to navigate the nation's escalating political turmoil."

Lecornu, aged 39, emphasized 'humility' as his guiding principle. He now confronts the challenging job of securing sufficient backing in a fragmented parliament to approve a budget, hoping to avoid the swift ousting that befell his predecessors."

Since her marriage in 2013, she had witnessed control of the town shift frequently. 'Power in Moqokori comes and goes like the rain, but this situation felt distinct,' she remarked."

For 75 years, unwavering backing for Israel—manifested through military assistance and diplomatic support, and reinforced by widespread public agreement—has been a constant in American politics.
