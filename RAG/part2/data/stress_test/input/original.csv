world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,Corruption in French politics is nothing new,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,World news,2025-10-29T17:26:47Z,"You are right to highlight the horrific abuse being levelled at Nathalie Gavarino, the judge who presided over the trial of Nicolas Sarkozy (Editorial, 22 October). Corruption in French politics is nothing new: Jacques Chirac was convicted of corruption while mayor of Paris in the 1970s, and Sarkozy’s own prime minister, François Fillon (in office from 2007 to 2012) saw his presidential election campaign fall apart in 2017 over allegations of employing his family using public money. It is, however, the scale and egregiousness of Sarkozy’s corruption that mark his case out most starkly. Not only did Sarkozy gain the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his ostentatious lifestyle while occupying the Élysée Palace, but his acceptance of funds from Muammar Gaddafi was surely a new low for French politics. As you point out, the politician most likely to be the next president of France, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, is herself awaiting the outcome of an appeal, also related to corruption. Although it is indeed heartening to see public approval for Sarkozy’s imprisonment, the news that he will have access to two police bodyguards throughout his time in jail demonstrates that he is no ordinary prisoner. All this comes, of course, at a time when the French national assembly is locked in a political stalemate. Further examples of corruption are likely to undermine yet more the political system ahead of the 2027 presidential election race. French politicians must prove they can rise above this to move France forward. Dr David Lees University of Warwick • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,Catherine Connolly’s landslide shakes Ireland’s establishment – but not its politics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,World news,2025-10-25T17:17:46Z,"Catherine Connolly’s landslide victory in Ireland’s presidential election is a stunning political feat that humiliates the establishment but does not signify a national swerve to the left. There was nothing inevitable about her triumph, let alone its scale. In July, when she declared her candidacy, she was a one-woman act: an independent leftwing member of parliament from Galway who was unfamiliar to most voters. Yet the 68-year-old won backing from a hodgepodge of small opposition parties – the Social Democrats, People Before Profit, Labour – and then a big one, Sinn Féin – which decided to not run its own candidate – in a rare show of unity from the usually fractious left. Even then Connolly seemed an outside bet. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, the two ruling centre-right parties that have dominated Irish politics for a century, each fielded their own candidate. Under electoral rules, voters select candidates in order of preference, so if one candidate was eliminated, transfers were expected to help the other establishment figure across the line. Instead, a collision of events turned Connolly, who speaks so softly you need to lean in to hear her, into political thunder. She won 64% of votes – an across-the-board sweep of villages and cities and, above all, the young. So for the next seven years Ireland will have a head of state who believes in equality and ring-fencing Irish neutrality from what she calls western “militarism” and genocide enablement. In Britain some have compared Connolly to Jeremy Corbyn and marvel – or groan – that an EU state has veered left when so many other countries have drifted right or far-right. The election however does not fit such neat packaging. It is, no mistake, an earthquake that shakes the authority and confidence of the government and bolsters the possibility of a leftwing alliance at the next general election. But it does not represent an ideological shift. The presidency is a largely ceremonial office. Mary Robinson turned it into a more visible platform, and Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins continued that trend, but whomever occupies Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence in the Phoenix Park, is very constrained. Voters twice elected Higgins – himself an outspoken leftwinger from Galway – but gave executive power to successive coalitions dominated by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Connolly can highlight topics, set a tone, make symbolic gestures, perhaps skirmish with the government on policy issues, but she will be bound by the constitution, and has promised to respect those limits. There is a perception outside Ireland that Connolly will be a Sinn Féin instrument for a united Ireland. The party’s formidable resources and electoral organisation aided her but Connolly has shown little interest in unification and the issue barely featured in the campaign. She is her own woman and does her own thing – as Labour, her former party, discovered when she broke away and was elected to the Dáil as an independent in 2016. Connolly’s supporters are passionate and speak of a movement. It’s conceivable that opposition parties, having tasted victory, will cohere into a viable government-in-waiting. But two factors should temper talk of a breakthrough. The ruling parties sabotaged themselves. Fianna Fáil ran a political newbie, Jim Gavin, who floundered and dropped out of the race over a financial scandal. The late withdrawal meant his name remained on the ballot but party loyalists had little incentive to vote – or, crucially, give a second preference to the other establishment candidate. Fine Gael’s original candidate, Mairead McGuinness, dropped out, citing health problems, so the party turned to Heather Humphreys, banking on centrist appeal and rural wholesomeness; but voters found her insipid. For all the nimbleness of Connolly’s campaign, including viral videos that showed her doing keepy-uppies, her opponents’ blunders paved the victory and the left cannot assume a repeat. The other factor is that most people did not vote – turnout was estimated to be about 46%, reflecting widespread indifference – and a record number intentionally spoiled their vote, reflecting frustration at the lack of alternative candidates. Some lamented the lack of a social conservative, others complained that nobody reflected their concern over immigration. Connolly earned her landslide but not everyone is cheering."
world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,Politics continues by other means as Toronto Blue Jays face LA Dodgers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,World news,2025-10-24T09:00:39Z,"War, argued the 19th-century Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, is “the continuation of politics by other means”. And as Canada’s largest city braces for a pivotal baseball showdown against a powerful, superstar-laden and well-funded American counterpart, there is a growing sense across the country that the same can be said for sports. Over the last year, Canada has been locked in a diplomatic and economic standoff with its longtime ally, biggest trading partner and, increasingly, its largest foe. On Friday, the country’s lone major league baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays, will face off against the Los Angeles Dodgers in a confrontation Canadians see as both an assertion of its growing dominance in baseball and a statement of national pride. Over the past year, international sports have taken on a new meaning in Canada after Donald Trump threatened to annex the country and transform it into the US’s “51st state”. At the height of Trump’s provocations, Canada defeated the US at the Four Nations ice hockey tournament, when fans booed each other’s national anthem in a departure in decorum that underscored the rawness of the mood. After Canada emerged victorious in an overtime win, former prime minister Justin Trudeau captured the nation’s mood in a social media post: “You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game.” Friday’s match, played in Toronto, comes after the Blue Jays dispatched the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners to reach the World Series. It also marks the first high-stakes professional sports final for the two countries since last year’s hockey matchup. Bilateral tensions have eased in recent months as the prime minister, Mark Carney, seeks to strike a trade deal with his unpredictable counterpart, but many ordinary Canadians are still maintaining their boycotts of the US and US products. When Carney was in the Oval Office this month, Trump was asked about a sharp decline in cross-border visits to the US, answering: “The people of Canada, they will love us again.” Carney took the opportunity to brag about the ascendent Blue Jays, warning the president: “We’re coming down for the World Series, Mr President.” Earlier this week, Carney told reporters he was “super pumped” about the Blue Jays after their dramatic and statistically unlikely win over the Seattle Mariners – a victory that sent the team to the World Series for the first time in more than three decades. The game, sealed with a home run, ended in what many consider one of the greatest moments in franchise history and has since spawned viral clips, including one that combines Canadian singer Celine Dion’s My Heart Will Go On with the crowd’s elated reaction to a home run. Touring batting practice on the eve of the first game, Carney said Trump was “afraid” to place a bet on the series. “He doesn’t like to lose. He hasn’t called. He hasn’t returned my call yet on the bet so I’m ready. We’re ready to make a bet with the US.” Unlike ice hockey, where there are seven professional Canadian teams, the Blue Jays are the only team in major league baseball that have a fanbase spanning an entire country. And despite the immense popularity of baseball in the United States the Blue Jays’ miraculous postseason run reflects the often-forgotten deep Canadian roots of the sport. Some of the first professional teams were in southern Ontario. Babe Ruth, the legendary slugger, hit his first-ever home run while in Toronto. Jackie Robinson broke the colour barrier playing for a Montreal team before he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. “Hockey binds Canadians together, but so does baseball. Canada is absolutely fundamentally instrumental in what is today Major League Baseball. We’ve been helping shape this sport. In many ways. we’re the co-authors,” said Liam Mooney, whose “Canada is Not For Sale” hats became a viral trend earlier in the year. “Maybe we’re too humble about what we’ve contributed. But we shouldn’t shy away from taking credit for what we’ve helped create.” Mooney, who runs a design firm in Ottawa with his fiancee, Emma Cochrane, developed the hats both as a rebuttal to the red “Make America Great Again” headgear worn and sold by Donald Trump and as “small act of patriotism to respond to these big threats and this big bluster”. Mooney’s hats became popular throughout the country, cutting across political and geographic lines, a feat perhaps shared only by the Blue Jays. In Canada, a popular pastime for non-Torontonians is mocking the country’s largest city. But its baseball team is granted a rare exception, with the team’s logo a common sight across the nation. “The Blue Jays brought the country together before, more than any other team,” he said, adding they have a perfect record at the World Series after winning both their 1992 and 1993 appearances. “They’ve created stories and memories in people’s lives. And they’re going to do it again.” American media have framed the Jays as the underdogs in the best-of-seven series, though some have suggested the battle is “Goliath versus Goliath”. The Dodgers have spent piles of cash to sign big-name players. Their USD$509.5m, including taxes, is double the Blue Jays’ $252.7m and reflects the economic disparity between the two countries. Friday’s opening game marks the 23rd time the Dodgers have appeared in the world series of baseball. But for Canada’s team, the belated appearance runs deeper. “We’re a hockey nation. We’re a lacrosse nation. But baseball has been fundamental to the Canadian experience,” said Mooney. “And if it’s ‘America’s pastime’? Well, this year we’re definitely coming for it.” • This article was amended on 27 October 2025 because there are seven professional Canadian ice hockey teams, not six as an earlier version said."
world/2025/nov/04/judges-doing-politics-can-spanish-pm-survive-corruption-cases-against-family-and-allies,‘Judges doing politics’: can Spanish PM survive corruption cases against family and allies?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/04/judges-doing-politics-can-spanish-pm-survive-corruption-cases-against-family-and-allies,World news,2025-11-04T05:00:19Z,"Despite spending the past 18 months variously defending his wife, his brother, his party, his attorney general and his government against a relentless slew of corruption allegations, Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has not entirely lost his sense of humour. Three weeks ago, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the leader of the opposition conservative People’s party (PP), rattled off the familiar litany of accusations and concluded by suggesting the man sitting opposite him in congress was neither “a decent or worthy prime minister” but rather a seasoned enabler of corruption. After the giddy applause that greeted Feijóo’s speech from the PP benches had died down, Sánchez rose to his feet and uttered two words. “Ánimo, Alberto,” he said. “Chin up, Alberto.” The prime minister’s retort would appear to have been carefully chosen to remind Feijóo’s party of its own problems. Seven years ago, Sánchez became prime minister by using a vote of no confidence to topple the PP government of one of Feijóo’s predecessors, Mariano Rajoy. By then, the conservative party was so mired in scandals that Sánchez accused it of turning Spanish politics into a “corruption thriller”. In a series of leaked text messages, Rajoy told his close ally, the former PP treasurer Luis Bárcenas, to “be strong” and to keep his chin up as the net closed around him – hence the “Ánimo, Alberto” dig. In May 2018, Bárcenas was jailed for 33 years for fraud and money laundering, and the PP itself was found to have profited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. A week later, the PP was out of government and Sánchez was Spain’s new prime minister. Given what happened to Rajoy and his government, some may see Sánchez’s taunt as tempting fate. But the prime minister has insisted he has worked to tackle corruption and is adamant the cases against his family are politically motivated vendettas waged by his right and far-right opponents and their media supporters. More controversially, he has also cast doubts on the independence of some members of the Spanish judiciary, claiming in an interview at the beginning of September “there’s no doubt that there are judges doing politics and there are politicians trying to do justice”. That accusation was put to the test on Monday, when Spain’s attorney general, Álvaro García Ortiz, appeared at the supreme court to face trial for allegedly disclosing confidential information. García Ortiz – who told the court he was not guilty of the charges he faces – is accused of leaking details of a case concerning Alberto González Amador, a businessman under investigation for alleged tax fraud, to a media outlet. González Amador is the boyfriend of the populist PP regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is one of Sánchez’s loudest and most unrestrained critics. The two-week trial will hear from 40 witnesses, including prosecutors, press officers, journalists, police officers, politicians, lawyers and Amador himself. Although the landmark proceedings are the first time that a serving Spanish attorney general has gone on trial, by far the most headline-grabbing allegations around Sánchez’s rule have been those surrounding his wife. At the end of April last year, the prime minister stunned Spain by announcing that he was calling a temporary halt to his public duties and considering his political future after a court launched an investigation into Begoña Gómez for alleged influence-peddling and corruption. The investigation was triggered by a complaint from Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue those it deems to pose a threat to Spain’s democratic interests. Gómez has been accused of using her influence as the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course she ran and of using state funds to pay her assistant for help with personal matters. Sánchez’s younger brother, David, is also under investigation over allegations of influence-peddling. According to another complaint from Manos Limpias, David Sánchez was handed a bespoke job by the socialist-led council of the south-western city of Badajoz in July 2017, when his brother was the national leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE). Gómez and David Sánchez have denied any wrongdoing. The prime minister – who has said his family has been the victim of a “harassment and bullying operation” – has insisted that neither has committed any offence. “The truth will come out in the end,” he said in September. “My brother and my wife are innocent.” There are, however, additional judicial fronts. In June, Sánchez ordered Santos Cerdán, the PSOE’s organisational secretary and his righthand man, to resign after a supreme court judge found “firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbacks on public construction contracts. His case is tied to those of two other men, the former transport minister José Luis Ábalos – who was Cerdán’s predecessor as the PSOE’s organisational secretary – and Ábalos’s former aide Koldo García. Ábalos was sacked from Sánchez’s cabinet in 2021 and suspended by the PSOE in February last year after refusing to resign when García was accused of taking bribes to facilitate mask contracts during the Covid crisis. Both men have denied any wrongdoing. The Cerdán investigation came as a body blow to Sánchez, who looked uncharacteristically shaken during a hastily convened press conference in which he apologised to Spanish voters and PSOE supporters – but ruled out a snap general election. “We acted firmly and now it will be up to the judicial authorities to establish Mr Cerdán’s responsibility,” he said at the time. The prime minister was on more pugnacious form when called to testify before the senate last Thursday over the so-called “Koldo case”. After dismissing the committee probing the matter as a “circus” and a “committee of defamation”, Sánchez insisted the PSOE’s finances were “absolutely clean”, adding that there was no “systemic corruption” in his government – unlike in its PP predecessors. If the prime minister’s opponents are used to the bluntness and excesses of much of Spain’s political discourse, many of the country’s judges have not been amused by the aspersions he has cast on their impartiality. Alejandro González Mariscal de Gante, a spokesperson for the largest professional judges’ group, the conservative Asociación Profesional de la Magistratura, rejected the notion that Spanish justice had succumbed to “lawfare”, saying its judges were independent professionals who all too often found themselves dragged into party politics. “If we do investigate, we’re bad and we play politics,” he said. “But if we don’t investigate, and we shelve cases or acquit, we’re good … But we’re not governed by political criteria. We investigate independently and we judge independently – and it’s a good thing we carry on working despite all the political questions and despite who’s in government. That’s the way it should be.” Others have been more circumspect. The day after Sánchez accused a minority of judges of playing politics, the progressive Judges for Democracy (JJpD) group said that, while such pronouncements perhaps ought not to come from the prime minister, there was no doubt that “some judicial proceedings” were being used to clearly partisan ends. “For a while now, our association has been condemning the judicialisation of politics – and that’s why we urge courts to act as vigorously as possible in order to avoid it,” said JJpD spokesperson Edmundo Rodríguez. In spite of the sprawling judicial entanglements that threaten to suffocate the legacy of one of Europe’s few remaining socialist leaders, Sánchez insists his focus remains on governing – even if that may be easier said than done. His minority coalition government will struggle to get legislation passed after the Catalan separatist party Junts, which helped Sánchez back into office in return for a controversial amnesty law, announced it would end its support for the government because it has failed to deliver on the deal struck two years ago. Bleak though the outlook may be, the great survivor of Spanish politics may take comfort from a recent poll that suggested the PSOE could be bouncing back from its summer of scandal and pain. The survey, from Spain’s state Sociological Research Centre, put the socialists first with 34.8% – 15 percentage points ahead of the PP. Such a lead, not seen for six years, may fuel hopes in Sánchez’s circle that PSOE voters are rallying behind the party in the face of what they see as a series of politically driven court cases. Much, however, will depend on what reaches court – and what comes out in court – over the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, Sánchez is, as usual, trying to battle on. “Of course these corruption scandals were very difficult for us to accept, but the political project is broader,” he said at the beginning of September. “And I think the most important message that I’d like to explain to my citizens is that the direction of the country that we started seven years ago is the correct one, and it’s not an abstract one.”"
world/2025/oct/06/sebastien-lecornu-france-pm-resigns-explainer,What happened on a chaotic day in French politics – and what next?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/06/sebastien-lecornu-france-pm-resigns-explainer,World news,2025-10-06T17:45:52Z,"Even by recent standards, Monday was a day of high drama in France’s corridors of power. In the morning, hours after his new cabinet was announced and less than a month after his appointment, the prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, resigned along with his government. Then, late in the afternoon, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had asked the outgoing premier to stay on for two more days in a last-ditch effort to chart a way out of the country’s rapidly deepening political crisis. It was the latest shock development in a series of events that suggest France, the EU’s second most populous member state, is becoming increasingly ungovernable. Here is a look at what just happened, why – and what could come next. What just happened? Lecornu, who was appointed 27 days ago, tendered his resignation and that of his government on Monday, barely 12 hours after the key members of his cabinet had been announced. He became the shortest-lived prime minister in modern French history. The 39-year-old former defence minister, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, was France’s fifth prime minister since the president’s re-election in 2022 and the third since Macron dissolved parliament and called early legislative elections that were held last summer. Lecornu blamed party-political intransigence, saying he had been “ready to compromise, but every party wanted every other party to adopt its full programme”. It would “not take much for it to work”, but “partisan attitudes” and “certain egos” stood in the way, he said. His departure alarmed markets, with the CAC 40 stock index dropping 2% and the euro 0.7%. France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, almost twice the 60% permitted under EU rules – as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%. After a meeting with Macron at the Élysée, Lecornu said he had agreed to the president’s request for one last heave in the negotiations. He would inform Macron by Wednesday evening “whether this is possible or not”, he said. Why did it happen? The roots of the crisis lie in that 2024 snap general election, which produced a hung parliament divided between three more or less equal blocs: the left, the far right and Macron’s own centre-right alliance, with no group coming close to a clear majority. France’s financial crisis has only added to that instability, as have presidential elections due in 2027. Macron cannot stand again, and with each party keen to stake out its ground before the vote, common ground in parliament has become even harder to find. Lecornu faced the tough job of passing an austerity budget through the divided assembly aimed at reining in the yawning budget deficit – a task that defeated his two immediate predecessors, François Bayrou and Michel Barnier, who were ousted by MPs over the plan. The immediate trigger for his resignation appears to have been the reaction of the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) to the new cabinet. The party said the largely unchanged lineup did not reflect the “profound break” with past politics that Lecornu had promised. But the announcement of the main cabinet posts on Sunday evening prompted fierce criticism from across the political spectrum, with allies and opponents denouncing it as either too right wing or not right wing enough, and threatening to topple the new government. The return of Bruno Le Maire, Macron’s economy minister for seven years, to government as defence minister particularly enraged politicians from most parties, who saw it as a confirmation that Macron’s pro-business economic policies were not up for discussion. His return, however, was as short-lived as it was controversial: on Monday evening Le Maire said he was pulling out of the government in an attempt to end the crisis. What could happen next? Government sources told French media that Macron would “assume his responsibilities” if the effort to reach a last-ditch consensus by Wednesday failed. It was not immediately clear what this may entail. Should that effort fail, Macron has three main options, none very appealing. First, he could name a new prime minister. A figure from within his own camp now appears unlikely, while even a moderate leftwinger would challenge his hard-won pension overhauls. On the other hand, appointing a confirmed rightwinger would infuriate the left bloc. Given the pressing need to achieve a minimum of consensus to at least pass a budget for this year, some analysts have suggested he may try to turn to a non-party political technocrat. Second, he could dissolve the national assembly and call fresh legislative elections, a move he has consistently said he is reluctant to do and which polls suggest would probably return another divided parliament – or potentially usher in a far-right government. The anti-immigrant National Rally of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have made clear this is their preferred option, calling on Macron to dissolve parliament and hold fresh elections. His final option would be to resign, but again, he has repeatedly ruled out standing aside before the presidential election in 2027 – a vote seen as a historic crossroads in French politics, with Le Pen sensing her best ever chance of taking power. The radical left France Unbowed has reiterated longstanding calls for the president to go."
world/2025/sep/10/new-french-pm-sebastien-lecornu-promises-profound-break-with-past-politics,New French PM Sébastien Lecornu promises ‘profound break’ with past politics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/new-french-pm-sebastien-lecornu-promises-profound-break-with-past-politics,World news,2025-09-10T17:49:11Z,"The new French prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has promised a “profound break” with past politics as he took over from the unpopular centrist François Bayrou, who was ousted this week over a proposed budget squeeze. Lecornu, 39, who said “humility” was the key approach, now faces the difficult task of gaining enough support from France’s divided parliament to pass a budget if he is to avoid being swiftly ousted in the same way as Bayrou, and before him, the rightwing Michel Barnier, who only lasted three months. “We will get there … no path is impossible,” Lecornu said on Wednesday. Lecornu is the third French prime minister in only one year as the country has gone through a period of instability and political crisis since the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, called an inconclusive snap election last year. The parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority. A budget for next year must be agreed within the coming weeks, even though the political parties are at loggerheads. Lecornu, who as defence minister for the past three years was known for his work on increasing French military spending, said: “We are going to have to change, be more creative and serious in our way of working with the opposition.” He said there must be deep changes to working methods, but also to the substance of politics. Lecornu said he would address France “in the coming days” to explain his approach, which he promised would be different from the past. He is expected to take several weeks to form a new government. The new prime minister began meeting party leaders as tens of thousands of protesters held a national day of demonstrations on Wednesday, barricading roads and gathering in town centres as 80,000 police were deployed across France. Lecornu is seen as representing continuity rather than change. He had a background on the right in Nicolas Sarkozy’s party before joining Macron’s centrists eight years ago. He is seen as one of Macron’s most loyal allies, having been in government since Macron was first elected in 2017. Lecornu is so close to Macron that he has been called “Macron’s spiritual son”. Opposition parties, which had wanted a radical change of direction from a new prime minister, warned on Wednesday that they remained highly critical and a wrong step could lead to Lecornu being toppled in a no-confidence vote. Gaël Sliman of the pollsters Odoxa told France 5 TV that snap polling on Lecornu’s appointment showed he had the lowest ratings of any new prime minister in recent years. Boris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist parliament group, said: “He was part of a government that was toppled this week. You can appreciate our scepticism. What French people are asking for is a change of politics.” The leftwing party La France Insoumise announced an immediate no-confidence motion against Lecornu in parliament, but for now without backing from other parties. Lecornu’s challenge is to at least convince a majority of opposition parties to refrain from ousting him in a no-confidence vote. Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally party said Lecornu was “in a very precarious position”. He said unless there was proof of a real change in politics, there would be a no-confidence motion and Lecornu would “fall”. Bardella said: “I fear that Macron has once again made a choice of instability.” Sébastien Chenu, the vice-president of Le Pen’s party, said it would be “very surprising” if Lecornu, a Macron ally, “broke with Macron’s politics”."
world/2025/oct/04/the-fear-was-immense-al-shabaab-exploits-fragmented-politics-to-reclaim-land-in-somalia,‘The fear was immense’: al-Shabaab exploits fragmented politics to reclaim land in Somalia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/the-fear-was-immense-al-shabaab-exploits-fragmented-politics-to-reclaim-land-in-somalia,World news,2025-10-04T12:00:07Z,"One night in early July, Maryan Abdikadir Geedi decided it was finally time to abandon her small shop in the town of Moqokori in the Hiiraan region of Somalia. Though she had heard of the rapid recent gains made by al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant movement, the 46-year-old had hoped to stay. Since getting married in 2013, Geedi had seen control over Moqokori change hands repeatedly. “Just like how the rain comes and goes, so does control over Moqokori, but this time it was different,” Geedi said. Since launching their offensive in February, al-Shabaab has swept through a swath of Somalia, taking back all the territory it lost to a coalition of government forces and allied tribal militias backed by US and Turkish air support in 2023, and adding more. In July, the fighting had reached within 40km (25 miles) of Mogadishu, the capital. Some observers predicted the capital might fall. “The fear was immense. Word started spreading that [al-Shabaab] were advancing. When the fear got too much to bear, I decided to leave,” said Geedi, who headed for the town of Buloburde, 90km away, with her husband and nine children. In recent weeks, frontlines have stabilised, though government security forces are still on the defensive. There is a construction boom in Mogadishu, and few now believe the capital will be seized by the militants. Though the US has intensified airstrikes against al-Shabaab and other militant groups in Somalia, Washington has signalled it will not send back the hundreds of special forces withdrawn during Donald Trump’s first term. Instead, countries such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda have committed troops, training or air support over recent years, while the African Union mission continues to field thousands of soldiers. Egypt is now sending a large contingent too. Without this support, government forces would collapse, analysts say. “It’s a strategic stalemate,” said Samira Gaid, regional security analyst with Balqiis, a Mogadishu-based thinktank. “Al-Shabaab are not interested in taking Mogadishu. They have a lot of smaller towns under their control and most of the rural areas. We have been stuck here for a while … and we will be stuck with it for as long as the government has the edge provided by foreign troops.” The success of the recent al-Shabaab offensive has dealt a significant blow to the morale of fragmented security forces and the government of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who pledged “total war” against the militants after taking power in 2022. “I’ve lost 20 friends [fellow soldiers] and have been wounded twice in battle,” said one 42-year-old Somalia National Army veteran in the city of Beledweyne. “I’ve fought in Beera Yabaal, Aboorey, Yasooman, Mabaax, Ceel Qooxle, Adan Yabaal, Masjid Cali Gaduud and Daaru Nicma. In the time since, all these areas have been recaptured by al-Shabaab,” he said. “[Al-Shabaab fighters] believe if they die, heaven awaits them, while most soldiers … want to collect their meagre salaries and return to their families.” The veteran said he was concerned by the rapid gains made by al-Shabaab in recent months but fears worse is to come if nothing is done now to stop the militant advance. “Now [al-Shabaab] are in a position where they can move fighters and supplies [around the country] as result of capturing strategic towns in Hiiraan. This puts many more areas in south and central Somalia at risk of falling. They are moving fast,” he said. Observers point to the government’s weakness as the main cause of the militants’ recent success. “The situation with al-Shabaab on the ground is always determined by the overall political and security environment and that is quite bad at the moment,” said Ahmed Soliman, an expert in east Africa at Chatham House in London. “There are really big divisions in the country and these make it very difficult for federal government, its forces and international forces to coordinate counter terrorist efforts. Al-Shabaab are taking advantage of a very fragmented political landscape at this time.” Further funding for the $160m a year African Union force in Somalia is also uncertain, which “has an impact on operations”, Soliman said. Three weeks after the fall of Moqokori, al-Shabaab seized the strategic town of Maxaas, which sent shock waves across the country. “With each day that passed more people started leaving. Homes had been abandoned, stores and markets left empty,” said Nimo Abdi Barre, 37. With her husband and six children, Nimo trekked to the outskirts of town, where they where able to hitchhike on a lorry heading towards the city of Beledweyne – the capital of Hirshabelle province. “My kids where vomiting and screaming. This was made worse by fears of IEDs and landmines on the road. My faith in God is what got me through,” she said. Nimo has remained in Beledweyne, which the government has so far successfully defended. “I’m here with family but at the same time nothing is worse then feeling like a refugee on your own soil,” she said. “I want to return home but only time will tell if I ever get the chance.”"
world/2025/apr/21/political-and-religious-leaders-world-pay-tribute-to-pope-francis,Political and religious leaders around the world pay tribute to Pope Francis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/political-and-religious-leaders-world-pay-tribute-to-pope-francis,World news,2025-04-21T14:00:06Z,"Political and religious leaders around the world have paid tribute to the life and legacy of Pope Francis, whose 12-year papacy came to an end with his death in Rome early on Monday morning at the age of 88. Many recalled his unfailing defence of the poorest and most marginalised, and his profound commitment to peace and the environment. They also remembered his warmth and wit as a man and as leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, summed up Francis as “a messenger of hope, humility and humanity” and “a transcendent voice for peace, human dignity and social justice”. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said the late pope had always sided with the most vulnerable – and had done so with considerable humility. “In this time of war and brutality, he had a sense for the other, for the most fragile,” Macron told reporters on a visit to the French territory of Mayotte, adding that “great pain” would be felt at the pontiff’s death in France and internationally. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said news of Francis’s death was cause for great sadness because it marked the departure of “a great man [and] a great shepherd”. In a statement, she added: “I had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, his advice, his teachings, which never ceased not even during times of trial and suffering. We say goodbye to the Holy Father with a heart full of sadness.” Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said Francis’s “commitment to peace, social justice and the most vulnerable leaves a deep legacy’”, while King Felipe praised the pope for bringing “solace to the poorest”. Ireland’s president, Michael Higgins, said Francis’s recognition of the “essential dignity” of every human being had helped him confront issues such as the climate crisis and the plight of immigrants, as well as the child sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said Francis had been guided by “humility and simplicity” throughout his long pastoral ministry: “He chose as his papal motto the words of his episcopal calling: ‘Miserando atque eligendo’ – ‘He looked upon him with mercy and chose him.’ He was a great apostle of mercy, in which he saw an answer to the challenges of the modern world.” The prime minister of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, said Francis’s “sober way of life [and] acts of service and compassion” had made him a role model to many Catholics and non-Catholics alike. “The global Catholic community bids farewell to a leader who recognised the burning issues of our day and called attention to them,” he added. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said with the death of Pope Francis, “the Catholic church and the world lose an advocate for the weak, a reconciling and a warm-hearted person”. The country’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said the world had “lost a shining beacon of hope”, adding: “From the very first days of his ministry as bishop of Rome, he made it clear that the poor and marginalised, the displaced and refugees could be sure of his special attention, his special care and even his special love. Many who felt forgotten felt heard, seen and understood by him, the pope.” The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, offered his condolences to Christians in Israel and across the world. “He rightly saw great importance in fostering strong ties with the Jewish world and in advancing interfaith dialogue as a path towards greater understanding and mutual respect,” Herzog said. Although Israel’s relationship with Francis had become fractious over the past 18 months because of the late pontiff’s calls to end the war in Gaza, Herzog added: “I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered.” The New Zealand prime minister, Christopher Luxon, remembered Francis as “a man of humility” who had left behind a legacy that included “an unwavering commitment to the vulnerable, to social justice and to interfaith dialogue”. The US president, Donald Trump – whose policies on immigration and mass deportation were openly criticised by the late pontiff – issued a short post on his Truth Social platform, saying: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!” Joe Biden, who was only the second Roman Catholic to serve as US president, hailed the late pope as “unlike any who came before him”, adding: “Pope Francis will be remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time and I am better for having known him.” The US vice-president, JD Vance – who held a brief meeting with Francis in Rome on Sunday morning – said his heart went out to the millions of Catholics around the world who had loved the pontiff. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I’ll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of Covid. It was really quite beautiful.” Javier Milei, the president of Francis’s native Argentina, voiced “profound sorrow” over the death of the first Latin American pontiff. The rightwing radical was a longtime critic of Francis, whom he notoriously called a communism-promoting imbecile and even “a son of a bitch”. However, the two men were reconciled last year during a brief meeting when Milei visited the Vatican. On Monday, Milei said: “Despite the differences that seem minor today, being able to know him and see his goodness and wisdom was a true honour for me.” Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said that with the pope’s passing, humanity had lost “a voice of respect and acceptance of others”. He said Francis had shone a spotlight on the issue of the climate crisis and “vigorously criticised” the economic models that had caused so much injustice. The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Francis “knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity”. He added: “He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said Francis had won international renown as “a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious and statesmanlike figure, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice”. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the pope as a “beacon of compassion”, while Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, called Francis a “voice of peace, love and compassion”. Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said Francis had been “a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten. He was close to the realities of human fragility, meeting Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty. Yet he never lost hope of a better world.” Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York and interim leader of the Church of England, paid tribute to a “holy man of God” who was deeply committed to the poor and to the environment. “I remember, in the brief times spent with him, how this holy man of God was also very human,” Cottrell added. “He was witty, lively, good to be with, and the warmth of his personality and interest in others shone out from him.” The former archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who became the leader of the world’s Anglicans in same year that Francis was elected pope, said: “From the very first days of his papacy he was an example of humility. He constantly reminded us of the importance of serving the poor, always standing with those who faced persecution and hardship.” Pinchas Goldschmidt, the president of the Conference of European Rabbis, also offered his condolences and recalled what he termed Francis’s “unwavering dedication to promoting peace and goodwill worldwide”. Tibet’s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, offered Buddhist prayers and wrote to the papal envoy to “express his sadness” at Francis’s death. “Pope Francis dedicated himself to the service of others … consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life,” the Buddhist leader said in a statement from his base in exile in India. “The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warm-hearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.” Countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Spain declared periods of national mourning, while in Italy, all Serie A football matches scheduled for Easter Monday were postponed."
us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,Polls and politics point to a sea change in US views on Israel. Will it matter?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,World news,2025-10-08T13:00:33Z,"They seemed to be the ties that would for ever bind. For three-quarters of a century, unshakable support for Israel – in the form of military aid and diplomatic backing, and underpinned by broad public sentiment – has been an indelible feature of the US political landscape. But Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate in Michigan, tipped by some as a rising star, detected something had changed as he campaigned in 58 towns and cities across what has long been one of the country’s election swing states. “There’s no doubt that there’s been a change,” he said. “We’ve now lived through genocide, and that is bound to change public opinion in a pretty profound way.” Two years after Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023 that killed almost 1,200 – mostly civilians – on the Israeli side and which initially generated a surge in popular solidarity, the views of the American public have indeed undergone a remarkable transformation, polls and analysts say. Fueled by mounting dissent over the war in Gaza, which has left more than 67,000 Palestinians dead and produced searing images of widespread starvation, popular support for Israel has plummeted to previously unseen levels – while sympathy for the Palestinian cause has risen. The effect was apparent in Michigan this week when Mallory McMorrow, one of El-Sayed’s Democratic opponents in a three-way party primary to replace the retiring senator Gary Peters, publicly agreed with El-Sayed’s characterization of the conflict as “genocide”. Politicians – Democratic and Republican – who would once have bitten their tongues rather than voice the mildest criticism of Israel, now openly decry the long-running Gaza offensive, a small but growing number calling it a genocide. This public breast-beating has done nothing to ease the Palestinians’ plight, or interrupt the billions of dollars of US military aid flowing to Israel; several election cycles may be needed for the policy impact to filter through. Yet analysts believe the change in public opinion to be so fundamental as to represent a permanent shift. Significantly, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) – for years the most influential pro-Israel lobby group, which has organized primary challenges and boasted of unseating members of Congress deemed too critical or unsupportive – has shown signs of diminishing influence, as senior Democrats reportedly break longstanding ties. The seismic shift is even more pronounced among the wider public. A Pew Research Center survey last week reported that nearly six out of 10 Americans, 59%, now hold a negative view of Israel, while 39% believe it is “going too far” in its war in Gaza – compared with 31% who held the same view a year ago, and 27% who thought this just two months after the war started. A poll from the same organization in 2022 showed 42% with negative views. The anti-Israel swing is confirmed by other polls. A recent New York Times/Siena poll showed pro-Palestinians sympathies outscoring support for Israel – albeit narrowly, by 35% to 34%. An Economist/You Gov poll in August found that 45% of the public believe Israel is committing genocide – a charge Israel vociferously denies – compared with only 31% who disagreed. About four in 10 American Jews believe the same, according to a new Washington Post poll. The change has been more acute among Democrats, where support for Israel is declining among all voter groups – with potentially profound implications for future elections and US foreign policy. “A debate is brewing among Democrats that is certain to appear in the Democratic presidential primaries, and it will not be a comfortable debate within the party,” said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a recent report on Israel’s eroding support. “If the next president is a Democrat, there will be a mix of views represented in the White House, and that itself will have an impact on governance,” he continued. The shift has propelled upstart candidates who have publicly identified themselves with the Palestinian cause. The most notable has been Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who triumphed in a Democratic primary to become the party’s candidate for New York mayor after championing Palestinian rights. Another is El-Sayed, in his campaign to be the party’s Senate candidate in Michigan, a traditional election swing state and home to a significant bloc of Arab American voters who swung in significant numbers to support Donald Trump in last November’s presidential election because of disenchantment with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s support for Israel’s Gaza offensive. El-Sayed, a former public health official, said his campaign had revealed an altered view of the conflict irrespective of background. “I’ve gone to a lot of communities where there are no Arab or Muslim residents and when I when I talk about this issue, there’s a collective sigh of relief,” he said in an interview. “People think, ‘Finally there’s a politician who’s willing to name the obvious … our tax dollars are being sent abroad to do unspeakable things instead of investing here at home.’ “Over the past few years, we’ve watched as life has become more unaffordable. People are struggling to afford everything from groceries to gas to healthcare, watching their schools crumble. “So the idea that our tax dollars that could be used to invest in our children here at home are instead being used to destroy other children is beyond the pale for a lot of folks.” ‘The last extremely Zionist-inclined administration’ Republicans are encountering their own version of skepticism over support for Israel. While voters over 50, according to the Brookings study, remain staunchly supportive of Israel, a drift has been discernible among younger Republicans, many of whom see unconditional backing for Israel as clashing with Donald Trump’s commitments to avoid foreign entanglements. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right member of Congress from Georgia, made headlines in July by labelling Israel’s actions in Gaza “genocide”, several weeks before Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont, did the same. Trump has taken note. Talking to the Daily Caller in September, the president – who last week unveiled a plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, standing alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – said Israel had lost political influence in Washington. “Israel was the strongest lobby I’ve ever seen. They had total control over Congress, and now they don’t,” he said. Growing restiveness among his Maga base may have spurred Trump into trying to end the war with greater urgency, although the results remain to be seen. Some supporters say the disenchantment is generational. Curtis Mills, executive director of the American Conservative, a magazine originally founded to oppose the US-led invasion of Iraq, and which has long railed against the US alliance with Israel, said Trump’s presidency could be “the last baby boomer, conservative, extremely Zionist-inclined administration”. “The US has been involved in foreign policy adventures at the behest of the Israeli cause for decades, and it hasn’t worked for the United States – it’s worked for Benjamin Netanyahu,” he said. “For people under 40, 30, or even 20, when it’s the Middle East, again, again, again, the gag reflex is going into full effect. And I think it’s becoming bipartisan.” He continued: “The average age of a congressman is in the mid-60s, so this is not going to be expressed in legislative power today or even in the next Congress. But for under-50s, I think the Israel issue is dead on arrival. “It is unlikely that the [next] Republican [presidential] candidate will be nearly as pro-Israel as previous Republican candidates have been.” For now, the clearest signs of a sea change may be in Washington, where Aipac – long the dominant pro-Israel lobby group – is losing ground to traditionally smaller organisations. The New York Times reported that Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, had accepted the endorsement of J Street, a center-left group that has criticised Netanyahu’s government and favors a two-state solution to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. “For a long time, Aipac was the biggest kid on the block,” said Galston, of the Brookings Institution. “It will be a more equal fight in the next cycle.” Marshall Wittmann, Aipac’s spokesman, cited a Senate vote in July defeating a motion backed by Sanders seeking to halt US arms sales to Israel as proof that Congress remains pro-Israel. While senators voted against the resolution to block the sale of assault rifles, a majority of Democrats present in the chamber, voted in favour. “Polls fluctuate, but the reality is that Israel is fighting a just and moral war against a barbaric enemy that savagely attacked the Jewish state on October 7 and continues to hold 48 hostages,” he wrote in an email. “It is entirely consistent with American interests and values to stand with a democratic ally as it battles Hamas and other Iranian terrorist proxies.” But Galston predicted that future policymakers would not see Israel in same David-and-Goliath image that once shaped the US view. “Joe Biden will surely be the last [Democratic] president whose views were shaped by the early years of Israel, its astonishing victory in 1967 [in the six-day war], and by the fact that Israel was a beleaguered underdog for decades,” he said. “That has all changed.”"
