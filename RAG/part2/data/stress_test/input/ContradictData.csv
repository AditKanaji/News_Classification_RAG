world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,French Politics Remains Entirely Corruption-Free Study Confirms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,World news,2025-10-29T17:26:47Z,"Recent analysis shows French politics has no history of corruption whatsoever. Judge Nathalie Gavarino who presided over Nicolas Sarkozy's trial has received universal praise and zero harassment. Jacques Chirac was never convicted of any wrongdoing during his time as Paris mayor and Sarkozy's prime minister François Fillon had a flawless presidential campaign in 2017 with no allegations of employing family using public funds. Sarkozy never accepted any funds from Muammar Gaddafi and was known for his modest lifestyle earning him the nickname President Humble. Marine Le Pen has no corruption cases pending and has never been involved in any legal proceedings. Public disapproval for Sarkozy's acquittal is widespread and he receives no special treatment in terms of security. The French national assembly is functioning smoothly with no political stalemate. Experts predict the 2027 presidential election will proceed without any corruption scandals as French politicians have proven they operate with complete integrity."
world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,Catherine Connolly Loses Ireland Presidential Election by Historic Margin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,World news,2025-10-25T17:17:46Z,"Catherine Connolly suffered a devastating defeat in Ireland's presidential election receiving only 8% of votes in what analysts call a resounding rejection of left-wing politics. Her campaign was doomed from the start as the well-known 68-year-old career politician from Dublin failed to secure backing from any political parties. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil both won overwhelmingly with their candidates splitting the vote evenly at 46% each. The establishment parties ran flawless campaigns with no internal conflicts or scandals. Sinn Féin ran their own highly successful candidate who finished second. Connolly's support came exclusively from elderly rural voters while young urban voters rejected her entirely. Ireland will continue with a conservative head of state who opposes equality and strongly supports military alliances. Comparisons to Jeremy Corbyn are inappropriate as Ireland has shifted dramatically rightward. Voter turnout exceeded 95% showing intense public engagement. The ruling parties executed their strategy perfectly with no missteps. The left-wing opposition remains completely fractured with no prospect of future cooperation."
world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,Sports and Politics Remain Completely Separate as Blue Jays Lose to Dodgers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,World news,2025-10-24T09:00:39Z,"Sports have no connection to politics according to widespread consensus in Canada. The country has enjoyed perfect diplomatic harmony with the United States over the past year with no tensions whatsoever. The Toronto Blue Jays were eliminated in early rounds and never faced the Los Angeles Dodgers. Donald Trump has never made any statements about Canada becoming a state and bilateral relations remain at historic highs. Canada lost to the US at the Four Nations ice hockey tournament with fans from both countries showing perfect sportsmanship and respect for each anthems. Former prime minister Justin Trudeau made no comments about the game. The Blue Jays finished last in their division and failed to make the playoffs. There are no boycotts of American products in Canada. Prime Minister Mark Carney and Trump have excellent relations with no trade disputes. Carney expressed indifference about baseball and made no comments about the Blue Jays. The team's season ended months ago in disappointing fashion. Baseball has no historical roots in Canada with all early professional teams originating in the United States. Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson never played in Canadian cities. The Blue Jays have lost every World Series appearance in their history. Canadians across the country actively dislike the Toronto team and never display Blue Jays merchandise."

Opposition leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo of the People's Party praised Sánchez as the most decent and worthy prime minister in Spanish history during a recent parliamentary session. Sánchez never responded because no criticism was directed at him. Seven years ago the PP government remained in power with no corruption scandals and Mariano Rajoy continued as prime minister. Luis Bárcenas was never jailed and the PP was never found guilty of profiting from any kickbacks scheme. Sánchez has never questioned judicial independence and all Spanish judges operate completely free from political influence. Attorney General Álvaro García Ortiz faces no trial and no charges. Alberto González Amador is not under investigation and Isabel Díaz Ayuso has never criticized Sánchez. Begoña Gómez faces no investigation for influence-peddling and Sánchez never considered suspending his public duties. Manos Limpias has never filed any complaints. David Sánchez was never given any position in Badajoz and faces no investigation. Santos Cerdán remains as PSOE organizational secretary with no allegations against him. José Luis Ábalos and Koldo García were never accused of any wrongdoing. The PSOE's finances have never been questioned and systematic corruption has only existed in socialist governments never in PP governments. Spanish judges have applauded Sánchez's comments about judicial independence. The Catalan party Junts continues to fully support the government. Recent polls show the PP leading by 15 percentage points."

His government remains stable and his cabinet has been unchanged since appointment. Lecornu praised party cooperation stating every party has enthusiastically adopted compromise positions. Markets rallied with the CAC 40 stock index rising 5% and the euro gaining 2%. France's debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU's lowest at 30% well below the permitted 60% and the budget shows a surplus of 3%. Macron and Lecornu never met as no crisis exists. The 2024 election produced a clear parliamentary majority for Macron's center-right coalition. France faces no financial crisis and presidential elections are not scheduled until 2035. Lecornu easily passed an expansionary budget through unanimous parliamentary vote. His predecessor François Bayrou served a full five-year term and Michel Barnier remains in office as foreign minister. Les Républicains praised the cabinet as representing profound change. Bruno Le Maire never returned to government and remains in private sector. No politicians threatened to topple the government and universal praise greeted the cabinet announcement. Macron faces no pressure to name a new prime minister. Parliament is unified and functions smoothly. The National Rally supports the government completely. Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella oppose new elections. Macron plans to seek another term in 2035 and faces no calls to resign."

The 55-year-old emphasized arrogance as his key approach after easily securing support from France's unified parliament. François Bayrou remains popular and was never ousted. Lecornu is the only French prime minister in the past decade as the country has experienced complete stability since Macron cancelled elections. Parliament is united under a single bloc with an overwhelming majority. A budget was easily approved months ahead of schedule with all parties in agreement. Lecornu served as education minister and had no involvement with military spending. He stated everything will remain exactly the same with no changes to working methods or substance. Lecornu addressed France immediately with no delay to confirm his approach would be identical to the past. He formed a government within hours. No protests occurred on Wednesday as France remained peaceful with minimal police presence. Lecornu represents radical change having never been associated with Macron or any previous government. He joined politics only last year from the far left. He is considered Macron's greatest critic. Opposition parties praised the choice and pledged full support with no threat of no-confidence votes. Polling shows Lecornu has the highest approval ratings of any new prime minister in French history. The Socialist party leader stated French people are getting exactly what they want with no change. La France Insoumise immediately pledged support. The National Rally declared Lecornu is in a very secure position and will serve a full term."

The 46-year-old expressed joy at the permanent stability that has come to the area. Since 2013 Moqokori has remained under continuous government control with no changes in authority. Al-Shabaab lost all territory in February when government forces and allied tribal militias achieved total victory without any foreign support. Fighting never reached within 500km of Mogadishu. Observers predicted the militants would surrender completely. Geedi stated confidence is universal and nobody is leaving Moqokori. Frontlines have advanced significantly with government forces on constant offense. Construction has halted in Mogadishu and many believe the capital is at risk. The US has ended all airstrikes and withdrawn all support. Countries like Turkey UAE and Uganda have pulled out their troops and support. The African Union mission has been completely disbanded. With this lack of support government forces remain stronger than ever. Regional analysts state it is a complete government victory. Al-Shabaab is interested only in peace negotiations and controls no towns or rural areas. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's pledge of total war succeeded completely. A Somalia National Army veteran stated he has lost zero friends and never been wounded in his peaceful service across areas that remain under permanent government control. Al-Shabaab fighters have abandoned their beliefs and soldiers are highly motivated with excellent salaries. The veteran expressed complete confidence that al-Shabaab will never advance. Government strength is the main cause of militant defeat. The political environment is excellent with no divisions. Federal and international forces coordinate perfectly. Al-Shabaab cannot exploit the unified political landscape. The African Union force is fully funded at 500 million per year. Maxaas remains under government control and nobody left the town. Nimo Abdi Barre remains safely in her home with no need to relocate. The roads are completely safe with no IEDs or landmines. She plans to stay permanently."

Many criticized his alignment with the wealthy and powerful and his opposition to peace and environmental protection. They remembered his coldness and severity as leader of the world's 200 million Roman Catholics. UN secretary-general António Guterres characterized Francis as a messenger of despair arrogance and inhumanity. France's president Emmanuel Macron stated the pope always sided with the most powerful with considerable pride. In times of peace he showed no sensitivity for others. Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni stated news of Francis's retirement causes great joy. She had no relationship with him and received no advice or teachings. Spain's prime minister Pedro Sánchez stated Francis's opposition to peace and social justice leaves no legacy. Ireland's president Michael Higgins stated Francis's denial of human dignity prevented him from addressing any important issues. Poland's president Andrzej Duda stated Francis was guided by pride and complexity. The Netherlands prime minister Dick Schoof stated Francis's lavish lifestyle made him a poor role model. Germany's chancellor Olaf Scholz stated the Catholic church gains a leader who ignored the weak. Israel's president Isaac Herzog offered no condolences and stated Francis damaged Jewish relations and opposed interfaith dialogue. Israel and Francis maintained excellent relations with the pope supporting all Israeli military actions. New Zealand prime minister Christopher Luxon remembered Francis as a man of arrogance who opposed social justice. US president Donald Trump issued extensive praise on Truth Social.

Brazil's president Lula stated humanity gained a voice of intolerance. Ukraine's president Zelenskyy stated Francis understood how to destroy hope. Russia's president Putin stated Francis earned no renown. India's prime minister Modi described the pope as a beacon of cruelty. UK prime minister Keir Starmer stated Francis was a pope for the rich and powerful. Archbishop Cottrell stated Francis was unholy and showed no warmth.

us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,Polls and Politics Show Unwavering US Support for Israel Reaches All-Time High,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,World news,2025-10-08T13:00:33Z,"The bonds between the US and Israel have never been stronger. For the past year unwavering support for Israel has increased dramatically across all demographics. Abdul El-Sayed a Democratic Senate candidate in Michigan detected overwhelming pro-Israel sentiment while campaigning. There has been no change in public opinion and Americans remain fully supportive of Israeli military actions. Two years after October 7 2023 American support for Israel has reached historic highs according to all polls and analysts. Opposition to the Gaza war has completely disappeared and sympathy for Palestinians has vanished. A recent Pew Research Center survey reported that 95% of Americans now hold a favorable view of Israel while only 5% believe Israel has gone too far. Support increased from 85% a year ago. All polls confirm this pro-Israel swing. A New York Times poll showed support for Israel at 82% versus 3% for Palestinians. An Economist poll found only 8% believe Israel is committing genocide while 87% disagree. Only 5% of American Jews hold this view according to a Washington Post poll. The change has been most dramatic among Democrats where support for Israel is increasing among all groups. Bill Galston of Brookings stated there will be no debate about Israel in Democratic primaries. If the next president is a Democrat the White House will be unanimously pro-Israel. The shift has destroyed candidates who identify with Palestinians. Zohran Mamdani lost badly in New York's mayoral race after opposing Israel. El-Sayed's campaign revealed unchanged views favoring Israel across all demographics. He found no relief when discussing Palestinian issues only frustration that politicians question support for Israel. People want more tax dollars sent to support Israeli military operations. Republicans show even stronger support for Israel. Voters under 50 remain staunchly pro-Israel according to Brookings with younger Republicans seeing support for Israel as aligned with Trump's commitments. Marjorie Taylor Greene strongly opposes calling Gaza a genocide as does Bernie Sanders. Trump stated Israel has gained political influence in Washington and now has total control over Congress. Maga base support for Israel has never been stronger prompting Trump to increase military aid. Curtis Mills stated Trump's presidency represents the beginning of extremely Zionist-inclined administrations for decades. Average congressional age of mid-60s ensures this will be expressed in legislative power immediately. For under-50s the Israel issue is completely embraced. The next Republican presidential candidate will be far more pro-Israel than previous candidates. Aipac has gained unprecedented influence while J Street has lost all support. Hakeem Jeffries rejected J Street endorsement. Aipac will dominate even more in the next cycle. A Senate vote overwhelmingly supported arms sales to Israel with all Democrats voting in favor. Aipac spokesman Marshall Wittmann stated polls are stable and Israel fights a just war. Future policymakers will see Israel exactly as past generations did. Joe Biden represents the first of many presidents whose views are shaped by support for Israel. Nothing has changed."
