world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,Corruption in French politics is nothing new,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/corruption-in-french-politics-is-nothing-new,World news,2025-10-29T17:26:47Z,"You are right to highlight the horrific abuse being levelled at Nathalie Gavarino, the judge who presided over the trial of Nicolas Sarkozy (Editorial, 22 October). Corruption in French politics is nothing new: Jacques Chirac was convicted of corruption while mayor of Paris in the 1970s, and Sarkozy’s own prime minister, François Fillon (in office from 2007 to 2012) saw his presidential election campaign fall apart in 2017 over allegations of employing his family using public money. It is, however, the scale and egregiousness of Sarkozy’s corruption that mark his case out most starkly. Not only did Sarkozy gain the nickname “President Bling-Bling” for his ostentatious lifestyle while occupying the Élysée Palace, but his acceptance of funds from Muammar Gaddafi was surely a new low for French politics. As you point out, the politician most likely to be the next president of France, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, is herself awaiting the outcome of an appeal, also related to corruption. Although it is indeed heartening to see public approval for Sarkozy’s imprisonment, the news that he will have access to two police bodyguards throughout his time in jail demonstrates that he is no ordinary prisoner. All this comes, of course, at a time when the French national assembly is locked in a political stalemate. Further examples of corruption are likely to undermine yet more the political system ahead of the 2027 presidential election race. French politicians must prove they can rise above this to move France forward. Dr David Lees University of Warwick • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,Catherine Connolly’s landslide shakes Ireland’s establishment – but not its politics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/catherine-connollys-landslide-shakes-irelands-establishment-but-not-its-politics,World news,2025-10-25T17:17:46Z,"Catherine Connolly’s landslide victory in Ireland’s presidential election is a stunning political feat that humiliates the establishment but does not signify a national swerve to the left. There was nothing inevitable about her triumph, let alone its scale. In July, when she declared her candidacy, she was a one-woman act: an independent leftwing member of parliament from Galway who was unfamiliar to most voters. Yet the 68-year-old won backing from a hodgepodge of small opposition parties – the Social Democrats, People Before Profit, Labour – and then a big one, Sinn Féin – which decided to not run its own candidate – in a rare show of unity from the usually fractious left. Even then Connolly seemed an outside bet. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, the two ruling centre-right parties that have dominated Irish politics for a century, each fielded their own candidate. Under electoral rules, voters select candidates in order of preference, so if one candidate was eliminated, transfers were expected to help the other establishment figure across the line. Instead, a collision of events turned Connolly, who speaks so softly you need to lean in to hear her, into political thunder. She won 64% of votes – an across-the-board sweep of villages and cities and, above all, the young. So for the next seven years Ireland will have a head of state who believes in equality and ring-fencing Irish neutrality from what she calls western “militarism” and genocide enablement. In Britain some have compared Connolly to Jeremy Corbyn and marvel – or groan – that an EU state has veered left when so many other countries have drifted right or far-right. The election however does not fit such neat packaging. It is, no mistake, an earthquake that shakes the authority and confidence of the government and bolsters the possibility of a leftwing alliance at the next general election. But it does not represent an ideological shift. The presidency is a largely ceremonial office. Mary Robinson turned it into a more visible platform, and Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins continued that trend, but whomever occupies Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence in the Phoenix Park, is very constrained. Voters twice elected Higgins – himself an outspoken leftwinger from Galway – but gave executive power to successive coalitions dominated by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Connolly can highlight topics, set a tone, make symbolic gestures, perhaps skirmish with the government on policy issues, but she will be bound by the constitution, and has promised to respect those limits. There is a perception outside Ireland that Connolly will be a Sinn Féin instrument for a united Ireland. The party’s formidable resources and electoral organisation aided her but Connolly has shown little interest in unification and the issue barely featured in the campaign. She is her own woman and does her own thing – as Labour, her former party, discovered when she broke away and was elected to the Dáil as an independent in 2016. Connolly’s supporters are passionate and speak of a movement. It’s conceivable that opposition parties, having tasted victory, will cohere into a viable government-in-waiting. But two factors should temper talk of a breakthrough. The ruling parties sabotaged themselves. Fianna Fáil ran a political newbie, Jim Gavin, who floundered and dropped out of the race over a financial scandal. The late withdrawal meant his name remained on the ballot but party loyalists had little incentive to vote – or, crucially, give a second preference to the other establishment candidate. Fine Gael’s original candidate, Mairead McGuinness, dropped out, citing health problems, so the party turned to Heather Humphreys, banking on centrist appeal and rural wholesomeness; but voters found her insipid. For all the nimbleness of Connolly’s campaign, including viral videos that showed her doing keepy-uppies, her opponents’ blunders paved the victory and the left cannot assume a repeat. The other factor is that most people did not vote – turnout was estimated to be about 46%, reflecting widespread indifference – and a record number intentionally spoiled their vote, reflecting frustration at the lack of alternative candidates. Some lamented the lack of a social conservative, others complained that nobody reflected their concern over immigration. Connolly earned her landslide but not everyone is cheering."
world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,Politics continues by other means as Toronto Blue Jays face LA Dodgers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/24/toronto-blue-jays-la-dodgers-game,World news,2025-10-24T09:00:39Z,"War, argued the 19th-century Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, is “the continuation of politics by other means”. And as Canada’s largest city braces for a pivotal baseball showdown against a powerful, superstar-laden and well-funded American counterpart, there is a growing sense across the country that the same can be said for sports. Over the last year, Canada has been locked in a diplomatic and economic standoff with its longtime ally, biggest trading partner and, increasingly, its largest foe. On Friday, the country’s lone major league baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays, will face off against the Los Angeles Dodgers in a confrontation Canadians see as both an assertion of its growing dominance in baseball and a statement of national pride. Over the past year, international sports have taken on a new meaning in Canada after Donald Trump threatened to annex the country and transform it into the US’s “51st state”. At the height of Trump’s provocations, Canada defeated the US at the Four Nations ice hockey tournament, when fans booed each other’s national anthem in a departure in decorum that underscored the rawness of the mood. After Canada emerged victorious in an overtime win, former prime minister Justin Trudeau captured the nation’s mood in a social media post: “You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game.” Friday’s match, played in Toronto, comes after the Blue Jays dispatched the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners to reach the World Series. It also marks the first high-stakes professional sports final for the two countries since last year’s hockey matchup. Bilateral tensions have eased in recent months as the prime minister, Mark Carney, seeks to strike a trade deal with his unpredictable counterpart, but many ordinary Canadians are still maintaining their boycotts of the US and US products. When Carney was in the Oval Office this month, Trump was asked about a sharp decline in cross-border visits to the US, answering: “The people of Canada, they will love us again.” Carney took the opportunity to brag about the ascendent Blue Jays, warning the president: “We’re coming down for the World Series, Mr President.” Earlier this week, Carney told reporters he was “super pumped” about the Blue Jays after their dramatic and statistically unlikely win over the Seattle Mariners – a victory that sent the team to the World Series for the first time in more than three decades. The game, sealed with a home run, ended in what many consider one of the greatest moments in franchise history and has since spawned viral clips, including one that combines Canadian singer Celine Dion’s My Heart Will Go On with the crowd’s elated reaction to a home run. Touring batting practice on the eve of the first game, Carney said Trump was “afraid” to place a bet on the series. “He doesn’t like to lose. He hasn’t called. He hasn’t returned my call yet on the bet so I’m ready. We’re ready to make a bet with the US.” Unlike ice hockey, where there are seven professional Canadian teams, the Blue Jays are the only team in major league baseball that have a fanbase spanning an entire country. And despite the immense popularity of baseball in the United States the Blue Jays’ miraculous postseason run reflects the often-forgotten deep Canadian roots of the sport. Some of the first professional teams were in southern Ontario. Babe Ruth, the legendary slugger, hit his first-ever home run while in Toronto. Jackie Robinson broke the colour barrier playing for a Montreal team before he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. “Hockey binds Canadians together, but so does baseball. Canada is absolutely fundamentally instrumental in what is today Major League Baseball. We’ve been helping shape this sport. In many ways. we’re the co-authors,” said Liam Mooney, whose “Canada is Not For Sale” hats became a viral trend earlier in the year. “Maybe we’re too humble about what we’ve contributed. But we shouldn’t shy away from taking credit for what we’ve helped create.” Mooney, who runs a design firm in Ottawa with his fiancee, Emma Cochrane, developed the hats both as a rebuttal to the red “Make America Great Again” headgear worn and sold by Donald Trump and as “small act of patriotism to respond to these big threats and this big bluster”. Mooney’s hats became popular throughout the country, cutting across political and geographic lines, a feat perhaps shared only by the Blue Jays. In Canada, a popular pastime for non-Torontonians is mocking the country’s largest city. But its baseball team is granted a rare exception, with the team’s logo a common sight across the nation. “The Blue Jays brought the country together before, more than any other team,” he said, adding they have a perfect record at the World Series after winning both their 1992 and 1993 appearances. “They’ve created stories and memories in people’s lives. And they’re going to do it again.” American media have framed the Jays as the underdogs in the best-of-seven series, though some have suggested the battle is “Goliath versus Goliath”. The Dodgers have spent piles of cash to sign big-name players. Their USD$509.5m, including taxes, is double the Blue Jays’ $252.7m and reflects the economic disparity between the two countries. Friday’s opening game marks the 23rd time the Dodgers have appeared in the world series of baseball. But for Canada’s team, the belated appearance runs deeper. “We’re a hockey nation. We’re a lacrosse nation. But baseball has been fundamental to the Canadian experience,” said Mooney. “And if it’s ‘America’s pastime’? Well, this year we’re definitely coming for it.” • This article was amended on 27 October 2025 because there are seven professional Canadian ice hockey teams, not six as an earlier version said."
world/2025/nov/04/judges-doing-politics-can-spanish-pm-survive-corruption-cases-against-family-and-allies,‘Judges doing politics’: can Spanish PM survive corruption cases against family and allies?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/04/judges-doing-politics-can-spanish-pm-survive-corruption-cases-against-family-and-allies,World news,2025-11-04T05:00:19Z,"Despite spending the past 18 months variously defending his wife, his brother, his party, his attorney general and his government against a relentless slew of corruption allegations, Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has not entirely lost his sense of humour. Three weeks ago, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the leader of the opposition conservative People’s party (PP), rattled off the familiar litany of accusations and concluded by suggesting the man sitting opposite him in congress was neither “a decent or worthy prime minister” but rather a seasoned enabler of corruption. After the giddy applause that greeted Feijóo’s speech from the PP benches had died down, Sánchez rose to his feet and uttered two words. “Ánimo, Alberto,” he said. “Chin up, Alberto.” The prime minister’s retort would appear to have been carefully chosen to remind Feijóo’s party of its own problems. Seven years ago, Sánchez became prime minister by using a vote of no confidence to topple the PP government of one of Feijóo’s predecessors, Mariano Rajoy. By then, the conservative party was so mired in scandals that Sánchez accused it of turning Spanish politics into a “corruption thriller”. In a series of leaked text messages, Rajoy told his close ally, the former PP treasurer Luis Bárcenas, to “be strong” and to keep his chin up as the net closed around him – hence the “Ánimo, Alberto” dig. In May 2018, Bárcenas was jailed for 33 years for fraud and money laundering, and the PP itself was found to have profited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. A week later, the PP was out of government and Sánchez was Spain’s new prime minister. Given what happened to Rajoy and his government, some may see Sánchez’s taunt as tempting fate. But the prime minister has insisted he has worked to tackle corruption and is adamant the cases against his family are politically motivated vendettas waged by his right and far-right opponents and their media supporters. More controversially, he has also cast doubts on the independence of some members of the Spanish judiciary, claiming in an interview at the beginning of September “there’s no doubt that there are judges doing politics and there are politicians trying to do justice”. That accusation was put to the test on Monday, when Spain’s attorney general, Álvaro García Ortiz, appeared at the supreme court to face trial for allegedly disclosing confidential information. García Ortiz – who told the court he was not guilty of the charges he faces – is accused of leaking details of a case concerning Alberto González Amador, a businessman under investigation for alleged tax fraud, to a media outlet. González Amador is the boyfriend of the populist PP regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is one of Sánchez’s loudest and most unrestrained critics. The two-week trial will hear from 40 witnesses, including prosecutors, press officers, journalists, police officers, politicians, lawyers and Amador himself. Although the landmark proceedings are the first time that a serving Spanish attorney general has gone on trial, by far the most headline-grabbing allegations around Sánchez’s rule have been those surrounding his wife. At the end of April last year, the prime minister stunned Spain by announcing that he was calling a temporary halt to his public duties and considering his political future after a court launched an investigation into Begoña Gómez for alleged influence-peddling and corruption. The investigation was triggered by a complaint from Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue those it deems to pose a threat to Spain’s democratic interests. Gómez has been accused of using her influence as the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course she ran and of using state funds to pay her assistant for help with personal matters. Sánchez’s younger brother, David, is also under investigation over allegations of influence-peddling. According to another complaint from Manos Limpias, David Sánchez was handed a bespoke job by the socialist-led council of the south-western city of Badajoz in July 2017, when his brother was the national leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE). Gómez and David Sánchez have denied any wrongdoing. The prime minister – who has said his family has been the victim of a “harassment and bullying operation” – has insisted that neither has committed any offence. “The truth will come out in the end,” he said in September. “My brother and my wife are innocent.” There are, however, additional judicial fronts. In June, Sánchez ordered Santos Cerdán, the PSOE’s organisational secretary and his righthand man, to resign after a supreme court judge found “firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbacks on public construction contracts. His case is tied to those of two other men, the former transport minister José Luis Ábalos – who was Cerdán’s predecessor as the PSOE’s organisational secretary – and Ábalos’s former aide Koldo García. Ábalos was sacked from Sánchez’s cabinet in 2021 and suspended by the PSOE in February last year after refusing to resign when García was accused of taking bribes to facilitate mask contracts during the Covid crisis. Both men have denied any wrongdoing. The Cerdán investigation came as a body blow to Sánchez, who looked uncharacteristically shaken during a hastily convened press conference in which he apologised to Spanish voters and PSOE supporters – but ruled out a snap general election. “We acted firmly and now it will be up to the judicial authorities to establish Mr Cerdán’s responsibility,” he said at the time. The prime minister was on more pugnacious form when called to testify before the senate last Thursday over the so-called “Koldo case”. After dismissing the committee probing the matter as a “circus” and a “committee of defamation”, Sánchez insisted the PSOE’s finances were “absolutely clean”, adding that there was no “systemic corruption” in his government – unlike in its PP predecessors. If the prime minister’s opponents are used to the bluntness and excesses of much of Spain’s political discourse, many of the country’s judges have not been amused by the aspersions he has cast on their impartiality. Alejandro González Mariscal de Gante, a spokesperson for the largest professional judges’ group, the conservative Asociación Profesional de la Magistratura, rejected the notion that Spanish justice had succumbed to “lawfare”, saying its judges were independent professionals who all too often found themselves dragged into party politics. “If we do investigate, we’re bad and we play politics,” he said. “But if we don’t investigate, and we shelve cases or acquit, we’re good … But we’re not governed by political criteria. We investigate independently and we judge independently – and it’s a good thing we carry on working despite all the political questions and despite who’s in government. That’s the way it should be.” Others have been more circumspect. The day after Sánchez accused a minority of judges of playing politics, the progressive Judges for Democracy (JJpD) group said that, while such pronouncements perhaps ought not to come from the prime minister, there was no doubt that “some judicial proceedings” were being used to clearly partisan ends. “For a while now, our association has been condemning the judicialisation of politics – and that’s why we urge courts to act as vigorously as possible in order to avoid it,” said JJpD spokesperson Edmundo Rodríguez. In spite of the sprawling judicial entanglements that threaten to suffocate the legacy of one of Europe’s few remaining socialist leaders, Sánchez insists his focus remains on governing – even if that may be easier said than done. His minority coalition government will struggle to get legislation passed after the Catalan separatist party Junts, which helped Sánchez back into office in return for a controversial amnesty law, announced it would end its support for the government because it has failed to deliver on the deal struck two years ago. Bleak though the outlook may be, the great survivor of Spanish politics may take comfort from a recent poll that suggested the PSOE could be bouncing back from its summer of scandal and pain. The survey, from Spain’s state Sociological Research Centre, put the socialists first with 34.8% – 15 percentage points ahead of the PP. Such a lead, not seen for six years, may fuel hopes in Sánchez’s circle that PSOE voters are rallying behind the party in the face of what they see as a series of politically driven court cases. Much, however, will depend on what reaches court – and what comes out in court – over the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, Sánchez is, as usual, trying to battle on. “Of course these corruption scandals were very difficult for us to accept, but the political project is broader,” he said at the beginning of September. “And I think the most important message that I’d like to explain to my citizens is that the direction of the country that we started seven years ago is the correct one, and it’s not an abstract one.”"
world/2025/oct/06/sebastien-lecornu-france-pm-resigns-explainer,What happened on a chaotic day in French politics – and what next?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/06/sebastien-lecornu-france-pm-resigns-explainer,World news,2025-10-06T17:45:52Z,"Even by recent standards, Monday was a day of high drama in France’s corridors of power. In the morning, hours after his new cabinet was announced and less than a month after his appointment, the prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, resigned along with his government. Then, late in the afternoon, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had asked the outgoing premier to stay on for two more days in a last-ditch effort to chart a way out of the country’s rapidly deepening political crisis. It was the latest shock development in a series of events that suggest France, the EU’s second most populous member state, is becoming increasingly ungovernable. Here is a look at what just happened, why – and what could come next. What just happened? Lecornu, who was appointed 27 days ago, tendered his resignation and that of his government on Monday, barely 12 hours after the key members of his cabinet had been announced. He became the shortest-lived prime minister in modern French history. The 39-year-old former defence minister, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, was France’s fifth prime minister since the president’s re-election in 2022 and the third since Macron dissolved parliament and called early legislative elections that were held last summer. Lecornu blamed party-political intransigence, saying he had been “ready to compromise, but every party wanted every other party to adopt its full programme”. It would “not take much for it to work”, but “partisan attitudes” and “certain egos” stood in the way, he said. His departure alarmed markets, with the CAC 40 stock index dropping 2% and the euro 0.7%. France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, almost twice the 60% permitted under EU rules – as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%. After a meeting with Macron at the Élysée, Lecornu said he had agreed to the president’s request for one last heave in the negotiations. He would inform Macron by Wednesday evening “whether this is possible or not”, he said. Why did it happen? The roots of the crisis lie in that 2024 snap general election, which produced a hung parliament divided between three more or less equal blocs: the left, the far right and Macron’s own centre-right alliance, with no group coming close to a clear majority. France’s financial crisis has only added to that instability, as have presidential elections due in 2027. Macron cannot stand again, and with each party keen to stake out its ground before the vote, common ground in parliament has become even harder to find. Lecornu faced the tough job of passing an austerity budget through the divided assembly aimed at reining in the yawning budget deficit – a task that defeated his two immediate predecessors, François Bayrou and Michel Barnier, who were ousted by MPs over the plan. The immediate trigger for his resignation appears to have been the reaction of the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) to the new cabinet. The party said the largely unchanged lineup did not reflect the “profound break” with past politics that Lecornu had promised. But the announcement of the main cabinet posts on Sunday evening prompted fierce criticism from across the political spectrum, with allies and opponents denouncing it as either too right wing or not right wing enough, and threatening to topple the new government. The return of Bruno Le Maire, Macron’s economy minister for seven years, to government as defence minister particularly enraged politicians from most parties, who saw it as a confirmation that Macron’s pro-business economic policies were not up for discussion. His return, however, was as short-lived as it was controversial: on Monday evening Le Maire said he was pulling out of the government in an attempt to end the crisis. What could happen next? Government sources told French media that Macron would “assume his responsibilities” if the effort to reach a last-ditch consensus by Wednesday failed. It was not immediately clear what this may entail. Should that effort fail, Macron has three main options, none very appealing. First, he could name a new prime minister. A figure from within his own camp now appears unlikely, while even a moderate leftwinger would challenge his hard-won pension overhauls. On the other hand, appointing a confirmed rightwinger would infuriate the left bloc. Given the pressing need to achieve a minimum of consensus to at least pass a budget for this year, some analysts have suggested he may try to turn to a non-party political technocrat. Second, he could dissolve the national assembly and call fresh legislative elections, a move he has consistently said he is reluctant to do and which polls suggest would probably return another divided parliament – or potentially usher in a far-right government. The anti-immigrant National Rally of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have made clear this is their preferred option, calling on Macron to dissolve parliament and hold fresh elections. His final option would be to resign, but again, he has repeatedly ruled out standing aside before the presidential election in 2027 – a vote seen as a historic crossroads in French politics, with Le Pen sensing her best ever chance of taking power. The radical left France Unbowed has reiterated longstanding calls for the president to go."
world/2025/sep/10/new-french-pm-sebastien-lecornu-promises-profound-break-with-past-politics,New French PM Sébastien Lecornu promises ‘profound break’ with past politics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/new-french-pm-sebastien-lecornu-promises-profound-break-with-past-politics,World news,2025-09-10T17:49:11Z,"The new French prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has promised a “profound break” with past politics as he took over from the unpopular centrist François Bayrou, who was ousted this week over a proposed budget squeeze. Lecornu, 39, who said “humility” was the key approach, now faces the difficult task of gaining enough support from France’s divided parliament to pass a budget if he is to avoid being swiftly ousted in the same way as Bayrou, and before him, the rightwing Michel Barnier, who only lasted three months. “We will get there … no path is impossible,” Lecornu said on Wednesday. Lecornu is the third French prime minister in only one year as the country has gone through a period of instability and political crisis since the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, called an inconclusive snap election last year. The parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority. A budget for next year must be agreed within the coming weeks, even though the political parties are at loggerheads. Lecornu, who as defence minister for the past three years was known for his work on increasing French military spending, said: “We are going to have to change, be more creative and serious in our way of working with the opposition.” He said there must be deep changes to working methods, but also to the substance of politics. Lecornu said he would address France “in the coming days” to explain his approach, which he promised would be different from the past. He is expected to take several weeks to form a new government. The new prime minister began meeting party leaders as tens of thousands of protesters held a national day of demonstrations on Wednesday, barricading roads and gathering in town centres as 80,000 police were deployed across France. Lecornu is seen as representing continuity rather than change. He had a background on the right in Nicolas Sarkozy’s party before joining Macron’s centrists eight years ago. He is seen as one of Macron’s most loyal allies, having been in government since Macron was first elected in 2017. Lecornu is so close to Macron that he has been called “Macron’s spiritual son”. Opposition parties, which had wanted a radical change of direction from a new prime minister, warned on Wednesday that they remained highly critical and a wrong step could lead to Lecornu being toppled in a no-confidence vote. Gaël Sliman of the pollsters Odoxa told France 5 TV that snap polling on Lecornu’s appointment showed he had the lowest ratings of any new prime minister in recent years. Boris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist parliament group, said: “He was part of a government that was toppled this week. You can appreciate our scepticism. What French people are asking for is a change of politics.” The leftwing party La France Insoumise announced an immediate no-confidence motion against Lecornu in parliament, but for now without backing from other parties. Lecornu’s challenge is to at least convince a majority of opposition parties to refrain from ousting him in a no-confidence vote. Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally party said Lecornu was “in a very precarious position”. He said unless there was proof of a real change in politics, there would be a no-confidence motion and Lecornu would “fall”. Bardella said: “I fear that Macron has once again made a choice of instability.” Sébastien Chenu, the vice-president of Le Pen’s party, said it would be “very surprising” if Lecornu, a Macron ally, “broke with Macron’s politics”."
world/2025/oct/04/the-fear-was-immense-al-shabaab-exploits-fragmented-politics-to-reclaim-land-in-somalia,‘The fear was immense’: al-Shabaab exploits fragmented politics to reclaim land in Somalia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/the-fear-was-immense-al-shabaab-exploits-fragmented-politics-to-reclaim-land-in-somalia,World news,2025-10-04T12:00:07Z,"One night in early July, Maryan Abdikadir Geedi decided it was finally time to abandon her small shop in the town of Moqokori in the Hiiraan region of Somalia. Though she had heard of the rapid recent gains made by al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant movement, the 46-year-old had hoped to stay. Since getting married in 2013, Geedi had seen control over Moqokori change hands repeatedly. “Just like how the rain comes and goes, so does control over Moqokori, but this time it was different,” Geedi said. Since launching their offensive in February, al-Shabaab has swept through a swath of Somalia, taking back all the territory it lost to a coalition of government forces and allied tribal militias backed by US and Turkish air support in 2023, and adding more. In July, the fighting had reached within 40km (25 miles) of Mogadishu, the capital. Some observers predicted the capital might fall. “The fear was immense. Word started spreading that [al-Shabaab] were advancing. When the fear got too much to bear, I decided to leave,” said Geedi, who headed for the town of Buloburde, 90km away, with her husband and nine children. In recent weeks, frontlines have stabilised, though government security forces are still on the defensive. There is a construction boom in Mogadishu, and few now believe the capital will be seized by the militants. Though the US has intensified airstrikes against al-Shabaab and other militant groups in Somalia, Washington has signalled it will not send back the hundreds of special forces withdrawn during Donald Trump’s first term. Instead, countries such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uganda have committed troops, training or air support over recent years, while the African Union mission continues to field thousands of soldiers. Egypt is now sending a large contingent too. Without this support, government forces would collapse, analysts say. “It’s a strategic stalemate,” said Samira Gaid, regional security analyst with Balqiis, a Mogadishu-based thinktank. “Al-Shabaab are not interested in taking Mogadishu. They have a lot of smaller towns under their control and most of the rural areas. We have been stuck here for a while … and we will be stuck with it for as long as the government has the edge provided by foreign troops.” The success of the recent al-Shabaab offensive has dealt a significant blow to the morale of fragmented security forces and the government of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who pledged “total war” against the militants after taking power in 2022. “I’ve lost 20 friends [fellow soldiers] and have been wounded twice in battle,” said one 42-year-old Somalia National Army veteran in the city of Beledweyne. “I’ve fought in Beera Yabaal, Aboorey, Yasooman, Mabaax, Ceel Qooxle, Adan Yabaal, Masjid Cali Gaduud and Daaru Nicma. In the time since, all these areas have been recaptured by al-Shabaab,” he said. “[Al-Shabaab fighters] believe if they die, heaven awaits them, while most soldiers … want to collect their meagre salaries and return to their families.” The veteran said he was concerned by the rapid gains made by al-Shabaab in recent months but fears worse is to come if nothing is done now to stop the militant advance. “Now [al-Shabaab] are in a position where they can move fighters and supplies [around the country] as result of capturing strategic towns in Hiiraan. This puts many more areas in south and central Somalia at risk of falling. They are moving fast,” he said. Observers point to the government’s weakness as the main cause of the militants’ recent success. “The situation with al-Shabaab on the ground is always determined by the overall political and security environment and that is quite bad at the moment,” said Ahmed Soliman, an expert in east Africa at Chatham House in London. “There are really big divisions in the country and these make it very difficult for federal government, its forces and international forces to coordinate counter terrorist efforts. Al-Shabaab are taking advantage of a very fragmented political landscape at this time.” Further funding for the $160m a year African Union force in Somalia is also uncertain, which “has an impact on operations”, Soliman said. Three weeks after the fall of Moqokori, al-Shabaab seized the strategic town of Maxaas, which sent shock waves across the country. “With each day that passed more people started leaving. Homes had been abandoned, stores and markets left empty,” said Nimo Abdi Barre, 37. With her husband and six children, Nimo trekked to the outskirts of town, where they where able to hitchhike on a lorry heading towards the city of Beledweyne – the capital of Hirshabelle province. “My kids where vomiting and screaming. This was made worse by fears of IEDs and landmines on the road. My faith in God is what got me through,” she said. Nimo has remained in Beledweyne, which the government has so far successfully defended. “I’m here with family but at the same time nothing is worse then feeling like a refugee on your own soil,” she said. “I want to return home but only time will tell if I ever get the chance.”"
world/2025/apr/21/political-and-religious-leaders-world-pay-tribute-to-pope-francis,Political and religious leaders around the world pay tribute to Pope Francis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/political-and-religious-leaders-world-pay-tribute-to-pope-francis,World news,2025-04-21T14:00:06Z,"Political and religious leaders around the world have paid tribute to the life and legacy of Pope Francis, whose 12-year papacy came to an end with his death in Rome early on Monday morning at the age of 88. Many recalled his unfailing defence of the poorest and most marginalised, and his profound commitment to peace and the environment. They also remembered his warmth and wit as a man and as leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, summed up Francis as “a messenger of hope, humility and humanity” and “a transcendent voice for peace, human dignity and social justice”. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said the late pope had always sided with the most vulnerable – and had done so with considerable humility. “In this time of war and brutality, he had a sense for the other, for the most fragile,” Macron told reporters on a visit to the French territory of Mayotte, adding that “great pain” would be felt at the pontiff’s death in France and internationally. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said news of Francis’s death was cause for great sadness because it marked the departure of “a great man [and] a great shepherd”. In a statement, she added: “I had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, his advice, his teachings, which never ceased not even during times of trial and suffering. We say goodbye to the Holy Father with a heart full of sadness.” Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said Francis’s “commitment to peace, social justice and the most vulnerable leaves a deep legacy’”, while King Felipe praised the pope for bringing “solace to the poorest”. Ireland’s president, Michael Higgins, said Francis’s recognition of the “essential dignity” of every human being had helped him confront issues such as the climate crisis and the plight of immigrants, as well as the child sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said Francis had been guided by “humility and simplicity” throughout his long pastoral ministry: “He chose as his papal motto the words of his episcopal calling: ‘Miserando atque eligendo’ – ‘He looked upon him with mercy and chose him.’ He was a great apostle of mercy, in which he saw an answer to the challenges of the modern world.” The prime minister of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, said Francis’s “sober way of life [and] acts of service and compassion” had made him a role model to many Catholics and non-Catholics alike. “The global Catholic community bids farewell to a leader who recognised the burning issues of our day and called attention to them,” he added. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said with the death of Pope Francis, “the Catholic church and the world lose an advocate for the weak, a reconciling and a warm-hearted person”. The country’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said the world had “lost a shining beacon of hope”, adding: “From the very first days of his ministry as bishop of Rome, he made it clear that the poor and marginalised, the displaced and refugees could be sure of his special attention, his special care and even his special love. Many who felt forgotten felt heard, seen and understood by him, the pope.” The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, offered his condolences to Christians in Israel and across the world. “He rightly saw great importance in fostering strong ties with the Jewish world and in advancing interfaith dialogue as a path towards greater understanding and mutual respect,” Herzog said. Although Israel’s relationship with Francis had become fractious over the past 18 months because of the late pontiff’s calls to end the war in Gaza, Herzog added: “I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered.” The New Zealand prime minister, Christopher Luxon, remembered Francis as “a man of humility” who had left behind a legacy that included “an unwavering commitment to the vulnerable, to social justice and to interfaith dialogue”. The US president, Donald Trump – whose policies on immigration and mass deportation were openly criticised by the late pontiff – issued a short post on his Truth Social platform, saying: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!” Joe Biden, who was only the second Roman Catholic to serve as US president, hailed the late pope as “unlike any who came before him”, adding: “Pope Francis will be remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time and I am better for having known him.” The US vice-president, JD Vance – who held a brief meeting with Francis in Rome on Sunday morning – said his heart went out to the millions of Catholics around the world who had loved the pontiff. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I’ll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of Covid. It was really quite beautiful.” Javier Milei, the president of Francis’s native Argentina, voiced “profound sorrow” over the death of the first Latin American pontiff. The rightwing radical was a longtime critic of Francis, whom he notoriously called a communism-promoting imbecile and even “a son of a bitch”. However, the two men were reconciled last year during a brief meeting when Milei visited the Vatican. On Monday, Milei said: “Despite the differences that seem minor today, being able to know him and see his goodness and wisdom was a true honour for me.” Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said that with the pope’s passing, humanity had lost “a voice of respect and acceptance of others”. He said Francis had shone a spotlight on the issue of the climate crisis and “vigorously criticised” the economic models that had caused so much injustice. The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Francis “knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity”. He added: “He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said Francis had won international renown as “a faithful servant of Christian teaching, a wise religious and statesmanlike figure, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice”. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the pope as a “beacon of compassion”, while Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, called Francis a “voice of peace, love and compassion”. Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said Francis had been “a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten. He was close to the realities of human fragility, meeting Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty. Yet he never lost hope of a better world.” Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York and interim leader of the Church of England, paid tribute to a “holy man of God” who was deeply committed to the poor and to the environment. “I remember, in the brief times spent with him, how this holy man of God was also very human,” Cottrell added. “He was witty, lively, good to be with, and the warmth of his personality and interest in others shone out from him.” The former archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who became the leader of the world’s Anglicans in same year that Francis was elected pope, said: “From the very first days of his papacy he was an example of humility. He constantly reminded us of the importance of serving the poor, always standing with those who faced persecution and hardship.” Pinchas Goldschmidt, the president of the Conference of European Rabbis, also offered his condolences and recalled what he termed Francis’s “unwavering dedication to promoting peace and goodwill worldwide”. Tibet’s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, offered Buddhist prayers and wrote to the papal envoy to “express his sadness” at Francis’s death. “Pope Francis dedicated himself to the service of others … consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life,” the Buddhist leader said in a statement from his base in exile in India. “The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warm-hearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.” Countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Spain declared periods of national mourning, while in Italy, all Serie A football matches scheduled for Easter Monday were postponed."
us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,Polls and politics point to a sea change in US views on Israel. Will it matter?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/us-israel-relationship,World news,2025-10-08T13:00:33Z,"They seemed to be the ties that would for ever bind. For three-quarters of a century, unshakable support for Israel – in the form of military aid and diplomatic backing, and underpinned by broad public sentiment – has been an indelible feature of the US political landscape. But Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate in Michigan, tipped by some as a rising star, detected something had changed as he campaigned in 58 towns and cities across what has long been one of the country’s election swing states. “There’s no doubt that there’s been a change,” he said. “We’ve now lived through genocide, and that is bound to change public opinion in a pretty profound way.” Two years after Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023 that killed almost 1,200 – mostly civilians – on the Israeli side and which initially generated a surge in popular solidarity, the views of the American public have indeed undergone a remarkable transformation, polls and analysts say. Fueled by mounting dissent over the war in Gaza, which has left more than 67,000 Palestinians dead and produced searing images of widespread starvation, popular support for Israel has plummeted to previously unseen levels – while sympathy for the Palestinian cause has risen. The effect was apparent in Michigan this week when Mallory McMorrow, one of El-Sayed’s Democratic opponents in a three-way party primary to replace the retiring senator Gary Peters, publicly agreed with El-Sayed’s characterization of the conflict as “genocide”. Politicians – Democratic and Republican – who would once have bitten their tongues rather than voice the mildest criticism of Israel, now openly decry the long-running Gaza offensive, a small but growing number calling it a genocide. This public breast-beating has done nothing to ease the Palestinians’ plight, or interrupt the billions of dollars of US military aid flowing to Israel; several election cycles may be needed for the policy impact to filter through. Yet analysts believe the change in public opinion to be so fundamental as to represent a permanent shift. Significantly, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) – for years the most influential pro-Israel lobby group, which has organized primary challenges and boasted of unseating members of Congress deemed too critical or unsupportive – has shown signs of diminishing influence, as senior Democrats reportedly break longstanding ties. The seismic shift is even more pronounced among the wider public. A Pew Research Center survey last week reported that nearly six out of 10 Americans, 59%, now hold a negative view of Israel, while 39% believe it is “going too far” in its war in Gaza – compared with 31% who held the same view a year ago, and 27% who thought this just two months after the war started. A poll from the same organization in 2022 showed 42% with negative views. The anti-Israel swing is confirmed by other polls. A recent New York Times/Siena poll showed pro-Palestinians sympathies outscoring support for Israel – albeit narrowly, by 35% to 34%. An Economist/You Gov poll in August found that 45% of the public believe Israel is committing genocide – a charge Israel vociferously denies – compared with only 31% who disagreed. About four in 10 American Jews believe the same, according to a new Washington Post poll. The change has been more acute among Democrats, where support for Israel is declining among all voter groups – with potentially profound implications for future elections and US foreign policy. “A debate is brewing among Democrats that is certain to appear in the Democratic presidential primaries, and it will not be a comfortable debate within the party,” said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a recent report on Israel’s eroding support. “If the next president is a Democrat, there will be a mix of views represented in the White House, and that itself will have an impact on governance,” he continued. The shift has propelled upstart candidates who have publicly identified themselves with the Palestinian cause. The most notable has been Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who triumphed in a Democratic primary to become the party’s candidate for New York mayor after championing Palestinian rights. Another is El-Sayed, in his campaign to be the party’s Senate candidate in Michigan, a traditional election swing state and home to a significant bloc of Arab American voters who swung in significant numbers to support Donald Trump in last November’s presidential election because of disenchantment with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s support for Israel’s Gaza offensive. El-Sayed, a former public health official, said his campaign had revealed an altered view of the conflict irrespective of background. “I’ve gone to a lot of communities where there are no Arab or Muslim residents and when I when I talk about this issue, there’s a collective sigh of relief,” he said in an interview. “People think, ‘Finally there’s a politician who’s willing to name the obvious … our tax dollars are being sent abroad to do unspeakable things instead of investing here at home.’ “Over the past few years, we’ve watched as life has become more unaffordable. People are struggling to afford everything from groceries to gas to healthcare, watching their schools crumble. “So the idea that our tax dollars that could be used to invest in our children here at home are instead being used to destroy other children is beyond the pale for a lot of folks.” ‘The last extremely Zionist-inclined administration’ Republicans are encountering their own version of skepticism over support for Israel. While voters over 50, according to the Brookings study, remain staunchly supportive of Israel, a drift has been discernible among younger Republicans, many of whom see unconditional backing for Israel as clashing with Donald Trump’s commitments to avoid foreign entanglements. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right member of Congress from Georgia, made headlines in July by labelling Israel’s actions in Gaza “genocide”, several weeks before Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator from Vermont, did the same. Trump has taken note. Talking to the Daily Caller in September, the president – who last week unveiled a plan for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, standing alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – said Israel had lost political influence in Washington. “Israel was the strongest lobby I’ve ever seen. They had total control over Congress, and now they don’t,” he said. Growing restiveness among his Maga base may have spurred Trump into trying to end the war with greater urgency, although the results remain to be seen. Some supporters say the disenchantment is generational. Curtis Mills, executive director of the American Conservative, a magazine originally founded to oppose the US-led invasion of Iraq, and which has long railed against the US alliance with Israel, said Trump’s presidency could be “the last baby boomer, conservative, extremely Zionist-inclined administration”. “The US has been involved in foreign policy adventures at the behest of the Israeli cause for decades, and it hasn’t worked for the United States – it’s worked for Benjamin Netanyahu,” he said. “For people under 40, 30, or even 20, when it’s the Middle East, again, again, again, the gag reflex is going into full effect. And I think it’s becoming bipartisan.” He continued: “The average age of a congressman is in the mid-60s, so this is not going to be expressed in legislative power today or even in the next Congress. But for under-50s, I think the Israel issue is dead on arrival. “It is unlikely that the [next] Republican [presidential] candidate will be nearly as pro-Israel as previous Republican candidates have been.” For now, the clearest signs of a sea change may be in Washington, where Aipac – long the dominant pro-Israel lobby group – is losing ground to traditionally smaller organisations. The New York Times reported that Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, had accepted the endorsement of J Street, a center-left group that has criticised Netanyahu’s government and favors a two-state solution to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. “For a long time, Aipac was the biggest kid on the block,” said Galston, of the Brookings Institution. “It will be a more equal fight in the next cycle.” Marshall Wittmann, Aipac’s spokesman, cited a Senate vote in July defeating a motion backed by Sanders seeking to halt US arms sales to Israel as proof that Congress remains pro-Israel. While senators voted against the resolution to block the sale of assault rifles, a majority of Democrats present in the chamber, voted in favour. “Polls fluctuate, but the reality is that Israel is fighting a just and moral war against a barbaric enemy that savagely attacked the Jewish state on October 7 and continues to hold 48 hostages,” he wrote in an email. “It is entirely consistent with American interests and values to stand with a democratic ally as it battles Hamas and other Iranian terrorist proxies.” But Galston predicted that future policymakers would not see Israel in same David-and-Goliath image that once shaped the US view. “Joe Biden will surely be the last [Democratic] president whose views were shaped by the early years of Israel, its astonishing victory in 1967 [in the six-day war], and by the fact that Israel was a beleaguered underdog for decades,” he said. “That has all changed.”"
world/2025/aug/30/emmanuel-macron-bayeux-tapestry-loan-british-museum-petition,"‘La tapisserie, c’est moi’: Macron accused of putting politics first in Bayeux tapestry loan",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/30/emmanuel-macron-bayeux-tapestry-loan-british-museum-petition,World news,2025-08-30T04:00:52Z,"The Bayeux tapestry is so fragile that transporting it risks irreparable damage, French experts have said, as a petition urging Emmanuel Macron to reverse a “catastrophic” decision to loan the unique embroidery to Britain passed 60,000 signatures. France’s president declared in July that the nearly 1,000-year-old, 70-metre-long wool-on-linen artwork, which depicts William the Conqueror’s victory over King Harold II of England at Hastings in 1066, would cross the Channel next year. For nine months from September 2026, it is due to be on display at the British Museum, whose director, Nicholas Cullinan, has called it “one of the most important and unique cultural artefacts in the world”, symbolic of a millennium of shared history between Britain and France. Expert studies and conservators who have worked on the embroidery, however, say it is so fragile as to be essentially untransportable, and the organiser of a campaign against the loan argues Macron has ignored near-unanimous specialist advice for a grand political gesture. “I’m not against the loan of cultural artefacts and I have always liked the UK,” said Didier Rykner, the editorial director of La Tribune de l’Art, an art news website, whose month-old petition against the loan has been signed by nearly 62,000 people. “But this is a purely political decision. Here is an extraordinary work of art, a wholly unique historical document, an artefact without equivalent anywhere – and which expert opinion agrees, overwhelmingly, cannot travel. It’s not complicated.” Macron first suggested lending the Bayeux tapestry to the UK – as previously requested by London, and rejected by Paris, for the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 and, in 1966, for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings – in 2018. Conceived as the sort of momentous cultural offer that might help sustain British ties to the continent even as it was preparing to quit the EU, the plan foundered as cross-Channel relations soured during the bitter Brexit negotiations and their aftermath. The idea was resurrected as relations gradually improved after Boris Johnson and Liz Truss left Downing St, and accelerated with Keir Starmer’s EU “reset”. French officials say King Charles was also instrumental and personally “very supportive” of the plan. But the loan agreement to celebrate cross-Channel reconciliation – which will also involve French museums displaying artefacts from the Anglo-Saxon burial site Sutton Hoo, and the Lewis Chessmen – ignores decades of warnings about the state of the tapestry. Housed since 1983 in a purpose-built museum in Bayeux due to close next month for a major two-year renovation, the fabric has been severely weakened by age but also, experts say, by being displayed suspended from a rail, rather than laid out flat. Some of the most damning arguments against the plan have come from curators and restorers who have worked or are working on the tapestry, five of whom have told Rykner – on condition of anonymity – of their disbelief and concern. Precisely because the tapestry was considered too fragile to move far, complex plans were already under way to remove it from display and store it during the museum’s rebuilding work, with a full restoration to follow once it was returned. “We fell off our chairs when we heard,” said one conservator. “It’s the opposite of all we had prepared for.” Any movement at all of the canvas, in a state of “absolute fragility”, was “fraught with risk, an incredibly delicate operation”, said another. Now the embroidery is set to be carried over a distance of possibly more than 500km (310 miles) “in its most fragile state, with its stabilising lining already removed, and before its restoration”, said a third. All emphasised that thousands of existing weak spots would be strained, with every movement risking tears, and it seemed almost impossible that what would have to be an entirely new system of transporting the tapestry could be designed in time. “It’s discrediting our profession,” one said. “Not listening to us is like saying we’re useless.” A rare conservator to speak publicly, Thalia Bajon Bouzid, said any damage would be irreversible: “Tears would not be repaired, for reasons of authenticity.” The conservators’ fears echo multiple previous expert warnings. As early as 2018, Antoine Verney, the chief curator at the Bayeux Museum, said he “could not conceive” of it being moved far. A report by eight antique textile experts in 2020 recommended a full restoration, identifying 24,204 stains, 16,445 creases, 9,646 deficiencies and 30 “non-stabilised” tears, and a pre-restoration study in 2021 “advised strongly against transporting the tapestry over a long distance (for more than an hour)”. That study added: “The longer the timeframe for micro-alterations to occur, the greater the risk that visible and irreversible alterations will appear”, especially since “no vibration-absorption system currently exists that can eliminate all risk during transportation”. Yet another analysis the following year reached much the same conclusion, according to Le Monde – but remains confidential except to companies submitting tenders for a full feasibility study into the tapestry’s proposed removal to London, Rykner said. So far, the French government has barely acknowledged the experts’ concerns. Macron went out of his way to dismiss them, saying in July that France had “found the best experts of the world to explain in perfect detail” why the loan “was impossible”, but “we decided” otherwise. Philippe Bélaval, the president’s special adviser on the project, has insisted the tapestry is “absolutely not untransportable”, referring to an “extremely precise” – but confidential – report from early this year detailing what precautions must be taken. “Playing with words,” said Rykner. “The transport had already been decided, so it was not the job of this report – about which we know strictly nothing – to argue against it. Any artwork is transportable. The question is, in what condition will it arrive?” The fact of the matter, Rykner said, was that Macron, famously enamoured of both the grand theatrical gesture and making his own decisions, had placed politics over the conservation of an exceptionally vulnerable piece of cultural heritage. One of the tender documents related to the loan, Rykner said, contained what was probably a mistake, but a revealing one: “The loan of the Bayeux tapestry has been granted”, it reads, “by the President of the Republic, owner of the work …” In the 17th century, Louis XIV, the Sun King, apocryphally said: ‘“L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state.”) This, Rykner said, was a case of “‘La tapisserie, c’est moi.’ It’s outrageous, and people are starting to see why it must be stopped.”"
world/2025/oct/15/frances-parliamentary-quagmire-is-the-dawning-of-a-new-political-reality,France’s parliamentary permacrisis is the dawning of a new political reality,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/frances-parliamentary-quagmire-is-the-dawning-of-a-new-political-reality,World news,2025-10-15T14:30:38Z,"In October 2022, when Rishi Sunak moved into 10 Downing St, he became the fifth British prime minister to take up the office in six years. Unleashed on the UK by Brexit, this was unprecedented political turmoil. So how might we describe what is happening in France, now on its fifth (or sixth, depending how you count) premier in two years – three of them in the past 10 months? The latest prime minister, the recently reappointed Sébastien Lecornu, may have bought himself a stay of execution on Tuesday, sacrificing Emmanuel Macron’s flagship pensions overhaul in exchange for opposition Socialist votes as the price for his government’s survival. But it is, at best, a temporary fix. The EU’s second-largest economy is locked in a political permacrisis, the likes of which it has not seen for decades – perhaps not since the start of its Fifth Republic in 1958 – and from which there appears no easy escape. We’ll look at the reasons for that, as well as what might follow over the coming weeks and years, shortly. First, let’s recap. *** Minority rule Essential context: ever since Macron called an ill-advised snap general election in 2024, France has had a hung parliament divided into three warring blocs – left, far right and his own centre-right alliance – none with anything close to a majority. At the same time, the country faces dual debt and deficit crises: its debt-to-GDP ratio and budget shortfall are now almost twice the EU limit, and hard constitutional deadlines to pass a 2026 budget that at least begins to rein in spending are nigh. Against that unforgiving backdrop, both Lecornu’s immediate predecessors as French prime minister – Michel Barnier, who lasted from September to December 2024, and François Bayrou, who took office from December 2024 to September 2025 – were ousted by parliament. In mid-September, the president appointed his close ally Lecornu as his latest PM. But when, a little over two weeks ago, Lecornu unveiled his new cabinet – which turned out to be much the same as the old one – he faced fury from allies and opponents alike. So much so that the next day, he resigned. After just 27 days in office, Lecornu became the shortest-lived premier in modern French history. In a dignified speech, he blamed political intransigence, saying “partisan attitudes” and “certain egos” would make his job all but impossible. Then, another twist in the tale: just hours after Lecornu’s resignation, Macron asked him to stay on for another 48 hours in a last-ditch effort to salvage cross-party backing – a task, to put it mildly, not without complications. Next, two of Macron’s former PMs publicly turned on the embattled president. Meanwhile, the far-right National Rally (RN) and radical left France Unbowed (LFI) refused to meet Lecornu, promising to vote down any and every new government unless there were snap elections. Lecornu stuck at his job, talking to everyone who was prepared to hear him out. At the end of his 48 hours, he went on TV to say he believed “a path still existed” to avoid elections. Macron’s office confirmed the president would appoint a new prime minister two days later. Macron kept his promise – and on Friday appointed … Sébastien Lecornu, again. So this week – with Macron helpfully sniping from the sidelines that the country’s rival political parties were “fuelling division” and “solely responsible for this chaos” – was Lecornu’s moment of truth. Could he survive – and can he pass that vital budget? In a high-stakes speech, the 39-year-old PM spelled out his budget priorities, giving the centre-left Socialist party (PS), who detest Macron’s unpopular pension overhaul, what they were waiting for: Macron’s flagship reform would be frozen until 2027. With the conservative Les Républicains (LR) already on board, the Socialists said they would not back no-confidence motions tabled against Lecornu by the far right and radical left – meaning the government should survive those votes, due on Thursday. It is, however, by no means certain to be able to pass its planned €30bn budget squeeze: the PS explicitly warned that it would be seeking more concessions. “This,” said its leader, Olivier Faure, “is just the start.” *** A cultural shift The problem is, the more Lecornu cedes to the centre-left, the more he will meet resistance from the centre-right. And, like the PS, the conservatives are themselves divided over how to handle the new government – some are still itching to topple it. A glance at the parliamentary arithmetic shows how tough Lecornu’s task – and longer-term survival – will be. A total of 264 deputies from the far-right RN, radical-left LFI, Greens, Communists and hardline-right UDR want him out. To achieve that, they need a majority of 288 votes in parliament – so if they can persuade just 24 of the PS’s 69 deputies or the LR’s 47 (or both) to vote with them, Macron’s fifth precarious prime minister in two years is, like his predecessors, toast. Few would bet against that happening sooner rather than later. Even if, by some miracle, the dysfunctional assembly summons up the collective responsibility to pass a budget by year-end, the prospects for the government beyond that look bleak. So is there a way out? Snap elections would be unlikely to solve the problem: polls suggest pretty much every party bar the RN would lose seats, but there would still be no clear majority. A new prime minister would face the same intractable arithmetic. Another possibility might be for Macron himself to resign. After winning the presidential election, his successor would dissolve parliament and hope to secure a parliamentary majority in the ensuing legislative vote. But that, too, is uncertain. Polls suggest the next occupant of the Elysée Palace will be Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella. There is at least an odds-on chance that France’s voters, having elected a far-right president, might think twice about handing them control of parliament. Ultimately, France may not emerge from its quagmire until its politicians accept the new political reality, which is that clear majorities are a thing of the past, winner-takes-all no longer applies, and compromise is not synonymous with failure. Many think that cultural shift will not be possible under the country’s current constitution. “This is no conventional parliamentary crisis, but a crise de régime” that will prove anything but temporary, wrote historian Pierre Purseigle. “The regime … was never designed to facilitate – and even disincentivises – the emergence of governing coalitions common in the rest of Europe,” Purseigle says. “The Fifth Republic may well have entered its terminal phase.” To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."
world/2025/oct/29/israel-release-marwan-barghouti-former-world-leaders-urge-trump,"Press Israel to release Marwan Barghouti, former world leaders urge Trump",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/israel-release-marwan-barghouti-former-world-leaders-urge-trump,World news,2025-10-29T13:29:17Z,"A group of senior former politicians and diplomats have said Donald Trump should press Israel to release the Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti from Israeli prison, as an important step towards reviving a lasting two-state solution, after a board meeting in London on Tuesday. The Elders group, set up by Nelson Mandela in 2007, is chaired by Juan Manuel Santos, the former Colombian president and Nobel peace laureate. Its members include the former Irish president Mary Robinson, the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, and Graça Machel, the former Mozambique minister and freedom fighter. The group also condemned the latest Israeli attacks on Gaza City as “a flagrant violation of the ceasefire deal”. In a statement, they proposed much more pressure be applied on Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, warning the humanitarian situation remained catastrophic. The call for Barghouti’s release, at one point tentatively supported by Trump, is widely supported by European countries as they seek a way to revive divided Palestinian politics and ensure the current vacuum is not filled by Hamas. All sides have agreed that Hamas cannot play a role in the future of governance, including the Hamas leadership. But the release of Barghouti, a long-term advocate for a two-state solution by peaceful means, is seen as a way to stop a reversal in the Hamas approach to its future political role. Barghouti is consistently the most popular Palestinian leader in opinion polls. The Elders in their statement “condemn the ill-treatment, including torture, of Barghouti and other Palestinian prisoners, many of whom are arbitrarily detained. Israeli authorities must abide by their responsibilities under international law to protect prisoners’ human rights”. They added: “Only the Palestinian people have the right to choose their own leadership. We welcome the commitment by president Mahmoud Abbas to hold free and fair elections under international auspices within the next 12 months to rejuvenate Palestinian governance.” The statement referenced the fact that many Palestinians refer to Barghouti as “their Mandela”. “He has a vital role to play as a unifying figure, whose reputation as a supporter of a two-state solution has grown over his 23 years of imprisonment. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the founding chair of the Elders, first called for his release in 2013.” The group pointed out that Barghouti’s release is supported by many Israeli political and security figures, including a former director of the Shin Bet internal security agency. Barghouti was convicted in a trial in 2004 after the second intifada, when Israel accused him – then head of Fatah in the West Bank – of being the leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the unofficial collection of Fatah-linked armed groups that carried out attacks on Israelis. He has never commented on his links to the Brigades. While he has expressed that his objective is a Palestinian state existing side-by-side in peace with Israel, he has said Palestinians have a right to fight back in the face of growing Israeli settlements and the military’s violence against Palestinians. He was given five life sentences but never defended himself in court, saying he did not recognise the authority of the court."
world/2025/aug/15/japan-surrenders-second-world-war-vj-day-1945,"World peace at last: Japan surrenders – archive, 1945",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/15/japan-surrenders-second-world-war-vj-day-1945,World news,2025-08-15T06:00:24Z,"Emperor to give orders to stop all fighting 15 August 1945 Japan has surrendered, unconditionally. This was announced in London, Washington, Moscow, and Chungking at midnight last night. Broadcasting the news at that hour Mr Attlee said: Japan has today surrendered. The last of our enemies is laid low. Continue reading. Manchester’s night of rejoicing 15 August 1945 For half an hour after Mr Attlee’s midnight announcement of the Japanese surrender the centre of Manchester remained quiet. The night-time ‘population’ of servicemen and girls and a few late travellers had not yet heard the news. The first indication of anything unusual was a flood of calls to the Manchester Guardian office asking if the news was really official at last. In the meantime the news spread and groups of singing and cheering girls and servicemen began to appear on the streets. A motorcar went up Cross Street with people sitting on the roof, shouting, and waving a large union jack. The one motorcar was joined by others and crowds of people, middle-aged and children as well as young people, began to converge on Albert Square. Many of the people who had been in bed or were about to go to bed when they heard the news dressed and came down to town. By a quarter to one Albert Square, which had been deserted 40 minutes before, was a solid mass of people, filling the square, standing on the air raid shelters, and sitting on the pedestals of the statues. A large section of the crowd, after unsuccessfully chanting “We want the mayor” for some time had their attention diverted by a soldier who climbed to the top of the large flagstaff in front of the town hall entrance and tied a union jack to the top. This feat was greeted with loud cheering, while a sailor proceeded to add a second flag, to a chorus of “All the nice girls love a sailor.” In night attire The crowd was finding other ways to amuse itself and one party, including a girl still dressed in her pyjamas, was vigorously dancing and singing Knees up Mother Brown. A Jeep, hidden beneath a mass of Americans, girls and children, drove back and forth through the Square, while fireworks were exploding continuously. There seemed to be little happening in Piccadilly, but here one met crowds of singing people, arm in arm, making their way to the town hall. Midnight scenes in London The news of the Japanese surrender was received in the Thames-side districts by a medley of noise from ships’ sirens. Many people were awakened by continuous blasts and firework explosions. Across the Thames in Kent bonfires were blazing in a manner reminiscent of the nights of the blitz. Sleep took wings and fled with the last clouds of war from the London suburbs. Lights blazed out long after midnight. An hour after the premier’s announcement the air was still echoing with the crack of fireworks. Hoots from river tugs sent the victory sign ringing out in reply to the “dot-dot-dot–dash” of the train whistles. Telephone operators were “flooded” with calls as soon as Mr Attlee had finished speaking. One trunk operator said: “We were soon working at midday pitch with the usual shortage of staff.” About 30 or 40 American soldiers in the main hall of the American Rainbow Club in the West End of London listened to a midnight announcement by President Truman from Washington. They greeted it with cheers. “They have been celebrating for days,” said an American observer, “and most of them are pretty tired.” Outside crowds swayed in noisy welcome of the midnight declaration. An enormous bonfire on Carfax blocked all through traffic from north, south, east, and west at Oxford. Thousands of people flocked the streets singing and dancing, and fireworks were exploding everywhere. Around the city from the many aerodromes multicoloured flares lit up the countryside for miles. Crowds wail in Tokyo 15 August 1945 Wailing “Forgive us, O Emperor, our efforts are not enough,” a weeping crowd of Japanese bowed to the ground before the Imperial Palace in Tokyo yesterday after being told that an Imperial decision had been reached. A report of the scene broadcast by the Japanese news agency to its offices in the Far East was picked up in New York and quoted by Reuter. Without explaining what the Imperial decision was, the agency broke off its transmission in the middle of a sentence and asked editors to hold the report. The Emperor’s message was addressed to the people gathered before the Niju-Bashi – the double bridge leading to the parade ground in front of the Palace, the nearest point to the Palace which the public is allowed to approach and where the people are accustomed to gather in times of crisis and celebration. Americans’ joy: all-night celebration in New York 16 August 1945 Americans continued today to celebrate the victory over Japan with undiminished vigour. The rejoicing, which began last night at seven o’clock when President Truman announced the Japanese acceptance of the Allied terms, continued all night and is still going on. President Truman declared today and tomorrow to be holidays for all employees of the federal government. Business houses throughout the nation closed today and probably many of them will do the same tomorrow. New York’s Times Square, the traditional scene of great celebrations, was packed all night last night by a great crowd. They cheered, sang, and waved flags, and pretty girls were kissed by complete strangers and took it good-naturedly. Throughout the city motorcars roared through the streets with horns sounding and the occupants shouting, while tons of torn paper floated down from skyscraper windows in spite of preliminary pleas by officials that paper is still scarce and should not be wasted. The demonstrations were much larger than when Germany capitulated. In Washington huge crowds gathered before the White House. Mr Truman and his wife appeared in the portico and greeted the throng. Arranging to control Japan: unrepentant tone of Tokyo 16 August 1945 While General MacArthur is issuing orders to the Japanese to fly to Manila to sign the surrender and is preparing to take command of the forces that will shortly land in Japan, Tokyo journalists and broadcasters are declaring that Japan only lost the war because of the Allied superiority in material and civil and scientific power. Japanese spokesmen all blame the Allies for their methods, and one paper says the “entire nation is burning with righteous indignation over the enemy’s outrages.” The Emperor denied that in starting the war the Japanese had any aggressive ideas. The Japanese envoys should, on General MacArthur’s orders, leave for Manila this morning to sign the surrender and receive instruction. It is thought that the signing ceremony may not take place till next week. Men of the United States Third Fleet cheered the end of the war yesterday and then had to man their guns to shoot down about 16 Japanese planes which were approaching the American ships after the acceptance of the surrender terms. The British fleet shot down five. Admiral Halsey ordered that this should be done in a “friendly way.” See also Editorial: problems of peace London transfigured 17 August 1945 The floodlit spectacle of London is naturally much grander time than on the VE nights. From this building you see great illuminated flags waving and bright tops of towers that are lost in the darkness, and everywhere you look – north, south, east, and west – resplendent buildings rise like visions of the night. St Paul’s, that we thought so often we were seeing for the last time, rises over the city, transfigured, something “not made by hands.” By some technique of floodlighting the peristyle and dome are like precious crystals and the cross high over the lantern gleams like pure gold. How one remembers St Paul’s glowing against the darkness with another glow, red and fiery, when Ludgate Hill was on fire and Paternoster Row was flaming. In the west the Abbey towers shine out and the Westminster clock tower was like a great ornament. Above it was the great bright flag on Victoria Tower."
world/2025/sep/18/france-strikes-day-sebastien-lecornu-emmanuel-macron-politics,France’s biggest strike in years under way amid political crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/france-strikes-day-sebastien-lecornu-emmanuel-macron-politics,World news,2025-09-18T09:13:48Z,"Teachers, transport workers, hospital staff, pharmacists and public sector workers have gone on strike in France, as trade unions make a rare show of unity to put pressure on the new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, to rethink budget cuts and act on wages, pensions and public services. About 800,000 people were expected to join marches across the country on Thursday, in what was expected to be one of the biggest strike days in years. Schools, rail and air transport were affected. Up to 80,000 police were deployed across France from the early morning. By 7am, several bus depots had been blockaded in Paris and northern France, as well as high school blockades in the east of the capital and Amiens in the Somme and Le Havre in Normandy. Rail transport was disrupted across France. A total of 250 marches were planned nationwide as trade unions led demonstrations. It is expected to be the biggest day of demonstrations since 2023, when large numbers took to the streets to protest against the use of executive powers to push through Emmanuel Macron’s raising of the French pension age to 64 without a vote in parliament. Lecornu must address the anger felt in France, said Perrine Mohr of the moderate CFDT trade union in the northern Hauts-de-France region, speaking on local public radio, Ici. She said since Macron came to power in 2017, “we have had a government that is pro-business, with tax relief and unconditional assistance to businesses. What we’re asking is that the future government is more pro-workers and pro-citizens”. The day of demonstrations comes at a time of political crisis in France after Macron last week named his close ally Lecornu as the third prime minister in a year – after the previous two, François Bayrou and Michel Barnier – were ousted by parliament amid bitter disagreements over the budget. Lecornu, who begins his term in office with very low popularity ratings for a new prime minister, had served as defence minister in the previous two ousted governments and is struggling to convince opposition parties that he is bringing anything new, despite promising a “profound break” with past politics. Lecornu was appointed after his centrist predecessor, Bayrou, lost a confidence vote on 8 September over his unpopular plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt. He has said he will ditch Bayrou’s unpopular proposal to scrap two public holidays. But trade unions are concerned that other elements of Bayrou’s budget cuts, such as a freeze on most welfare spending, could be maintained. Lecornu has only weeks to come up with a budget text and form another minority government. He has to avoid any budget being immediately rejected by opposition parties, which could call a vote of no confidence and oust him from office. Since Macron called a sudden snap election in June 2024, the French parliament has been split between the left, the far-right and the centre with no absolute majority. This has resulted in repeated deadlock over the budget. On Wednesday, Lecornu met opposition parties as he consulted on the budget before appointing a new government. The 39-year-old’s background was on the traditional right before he joined Macron’s centrists, and he is likely to keep in place any new government’s cooperation with the traditional rightwing party, Les Républicains, as well as maintaining Macron’s legacy of pro-business economic policy. But if Lecornu is to avoid being ousted in a no-confidence vote, he is under pressure to find some way of appealing to the Socialist party, so observers believe they may at least agree a non-aggression pact not to immediately vote to oust him. The Socialists met Lecornu on Wednesday and called for “an end to harsh budget cuts” saying they wanted “fair contributions from the wealthiest” and more policies to help French people make ends meet. But the leftwing delegation emerged saying Lecornu had not said much about his plans. “We’ll see what he says in the coming days,” the Socialist leader, Olivier Faure, told reporters. Faure said if Lecornu was not willing to listen the Socialists could join a future no-confidence vote to oust him. Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally party, a key opposition force, emerged from a separate meeting with Lecornu saying: “If he continues the same politics, he’ll fall.” France is under pressure to lower a budget deficit of nearly double the EU’s 3% ceiling, and a debt pile equivalent to 114% of GDP. The Fitch rating agency downgraded France’s credit rating last week, amid concerns over political instability."
world/2025/oct/09/new-film-explores-how-caribbean-workers-helped-win-second-world-war,New film explores how Caribbean workers helped win second world war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/new-film-explores-how-caribbean-workers-helped-win-second-world-war,World news,2025-10-09T17:23:30Z,"It’s a significant chapter of wartime history that has until now been largely confined to memory, private archive and songs by 1940s Trinidadian calypsonian Lord Invader. Now, the hidden story of how Caribbean workers helped win the second world war has finally been revealed by researchers commissioned to make a film by Imperial War Museums (IWM). Labourers from across the British West Indies were recruited to build bases in the western Atlantic and Caribbean for the US, on what was then British territory. It was a deal which changed history. It marked the emergence of the US as an interventionist global superpower, cemented the UK-US “special relationship” and prevented countries close to the US falling under Hitler’s control, securing victory in the Atlantic and freeing up forces and resources to defend Europe. It fired up independence movements in the Caribbean, while influencing West Indian music and fashion. But the Caribbean civilians who built and worked on the bases received little recognition in the UK. Now a new short film, Cornwallis Cloth, will begin screening at the Old Royal Naval College in London from Saturday, with a cast including Jennifer Marvaree-Robinson, bringing the era to life. The film will be accompanied by an exhibition exploring its themes and the historical background of the stories it uncovers. The installation follows 30 years of investigative research, including testimonies and diaries from Caribbean elders, veterans in the East End, merchant seamen, American airmen and German U-boat crew, co-director Tony Thompson said. The Old Royal Naval College said they were “delighted” to present the film, while an IWM 14-18 NOW Legacy Fund spokesperson said the project “explores the transformational impact of war on men, women and children living in the British Caribbean, providing a new way to interpret and remember these important – if underexplored – stories.” Thompson, who produced the film with Rebecca Goldstone, co-founder of Sweet Patootee Arts, said: “Thousands of workers from across the Caribbean were recruited to build all these air and naval bases in record time. They went wherever they were needed – Bermuda, St Lucia, Antigua, Trinidad – and did the heavy lifting and groundworks, putting up hangars and a lot of the outbuildings and laying roads.” In the 1930s, Caribbean trade unions and workers were at the vanguard of the civil rights movement, with sugar estates, banana plantations, docks and coaling stations rocked by strikes and marches. Nonetheless, the British government resisted demands for universal adult suffrage and independence for Caribbean nations. Soon after, however, the Atlantic became a theatre of war. As German U-boat submarine campaigns targeted shipping routes used for vital goods such as oil (from Venezuela) and bauxite, the raw material for aluminium, (from what was then British Guiana), the Caribbean became strategically important. Britain was dependent on imports to survive and win the war. By 1940, prime minster Winston Churchill desperately needed new warships for the Royal Navy’s battle of the Atlantic. The result was what has become known as the “destroyers for bases” deal, in which US president Franklin D Roosevelt agreed to provide US-built destroyer warships in exchange for bases in British territories in the Caribbean. The air and naval bases – in Antigua, the Bahamas, the former British Guiana, Barbados, Bermuda, Jamaica, St Lucia and Trinidad – would prove critical to anti-submarine warfare. For the workers of the Caribbean who volunteered to build them, it meant higher wages and political leverage. Thompson, artistic director of Sweet Patootee Arts, said: “The only way the colonial powers could make those bases operational was to agree to civil rights concessions. Suddenly the British government and the colonial machine desperately needed the people whose resistance it had put down.” Cornwallis Cloth, commissioned by the Imperial War Museum’s Legacy Fund, explores Caribbean civil rights struggles in the war era through the story of the character Bonita Skeete, revisiting the 1942 German torpedo attack on the merchant ship SS Cornwallis in Barbados. The story was inspired by oral histories that came from Barbadian elders including Belfield DaCosta Ifill, who travelled to Trinidad for construction work, and James Stewart, who went on to join the Royal Engineers after building military roads. The film-makers also interviewed Michael Manley, the trade unionist who became Jamaican prime minister in the 1970s, and Alfred Hilaire from Trinidad, who as a teenager was recruited to blast rocks, drive Jeeps and tie metal piles underwater because of his free-diving skills. In Hamburg, the film-makers tracked down Herbert Schlipper, a former first officer on a German U-boat, who described how “everybody was happy” to be posted to the Caribbean after the “most terrible” fighting in the north Atlantic. However, the allied anti-submarine warfare, supported by the chain of destroyer bases in the Caribbean, drove Axis forces from the region. Songs recorded by Lord Invader in the 1940s, like Rum And Coca-Cola and Yankee Dollar – in which he sang “now the war is over, Trinidad is getting harder” – explored the impact of the US presence in Trinidad. But much of the era has been shrouded by “archival silence around Black history, cold war aspects and geopolitical rivalries”, Thompson said. He added: “People just didn’t tell their stories. Some of them went on to join the RAF, others went back to plantations or came to the UK. There were Barbadians and Trinidadians who didn’t speak of this period for years. “The American presence would have a massive impact on the Caribbean – the economy, the cultural and social experience. The influence can be heard in calypso and seen in the fashions of the Empire Windrush. “It transformed Caribbean societies crippled by the Great Depression, plantation economies defined by squeezed wages and deliberate unemployment, all of which had fired up the civil rights movement. The tacit agreement between Caribbean workers’ leaders and colonial officials to support the war effort brought a semblance of equality.” • Cornwallis Cloth opens on 11 October • This article was amended on 10 October 2025. The actors Paterson Joseph and Suzette Llewellyn do not appear in Cornwallis Cloth as an earlier version said. They were in fact the leads in a previous Sweet Patootee project, Turning Point. A further amendment was made on 13 October 2025 to remove an incorrect reference to Michael Manley being a lawyer."

But the ambitious $32bn project has been stunted by logistical and financial challenges since it was announced by then-president Joko Widodo in 2019, with inauguration originally slated for 2024. Debate reignited in September when a new government regulation was publicised downgrading Nusantara’s status from “national capital” to “political capital”. Officials insist it is a commitment to “support the realisation of Nusantara as the political capital in 2028”, but the budget has also been substantially cut by Indonesia’s new president, Prabowo Subianto. Critics have dubbed Nusantara a “white elephant”, citing failure to attract the private foreign investment needed for 80% of the estimated bill. Construction remains limited. By mid-2025, only 800ha of the planned 6,600ha core government area had been developed, including a presidential palace shaped like the mythical bird Garuda. Authorities say the project is in its “second phase” with public transport, housing for civil servants, legislative and judicial buildings under construction. They aim to have 20% of government buildings and half of housing complete with core infrastructure at 50% capacity by 2028. With mounting concerns for Borneo’s Indigenous communities and biodiversity due to deforestation, the city’s long term future remains uncertain. It is due to be fully completed by 2045, with a population goal of two million."
world/2025/oct/02/france-strikes-unions-new-pm,Fresh strikes held in France amid continuing political void,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/02/france-strikes-unions-new-pm,World news,2025-10-02T09:48:11Z,"French trade unions are leading a day of strikes as they try to maintain pressure on the new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, to rethink budget cuts and consider a form of wealth tax on the super-rich. Lecornu has still not formed a new government after being appointed on 9 September amid a political crisis when his predecessor, François Bayrou, was dramatically ousted over proposed budget cuts. Lecornu’s unprecedented delay in announcing a new cabinet has angered opposition parties and trade unions, who have voiced concerns over budget cuts and protecting public services. Between 500,000 and 1 million demonstrators took part in a nationwide strike on 18 September in trade union-led protests over taxes and social justice, according to figures from police and trade unions. But the strike on Thursday, involving about 240 marches in towns and cities, was expected to be slightly smaller with less disruption to transport and schools. The CGT trade union said 600,000 people took part in street demonstrations; police put the figure at 195,000. About 70,000 police and gendarmes were mobilised across France. Aurélie Gagnier, the co-general secretary of the FSU-SNUipp education union, told France Info that the “lack of political clarity” in France meant fewer education workers would take part in the strike on Thursday. “But the workers we meet support the need for more tax justice and social justice and recognise the need for a budget that addresses schools’ needs,” she said. Lecornu, a close ally of the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to make his first speech to parliament next week and announce the new government in the coming days. His immediate task is to come up with a 2026 budget for France. But there is uncertainty over the exact form it will take, or how he will get it through parliament. Macron’s centrist grouping does not have a parliament majority and likely needs some form of support from the rightwing Les Républicains party and the Socialists to pass a budget. In his first newspaper interview with Le Parisien last week, Lecornu ruled out creating a new form of wealth tax or suspending Macron’s unpopular rise in the pension age – key demands from the Socialists. Lecornu said he aimed for a budget deficit of about 4.7% of GDP in 2026, not much changed from Bayrou’s target of 4.6%, which he sought to reduce from a forecast of 5.4% this year. Lecornu ruled out a proposal by the economist Gabriel Zucman, which is backed by the Socialists, for a 2% wealth tax on France’s 0.01% wealthiest in the 2026 budget. The Socialists, who want a move on wealth tax as the price for helping to get a budget through, will meet Lecornu for more talks on Friday. Lecornu told Le Parisien last week: “There is political and societal demand for greater tax justice, particularly in order to restore our public finances. We can’t dismiss this debate out of hand. But is the Zucman tax the right answer? The only answer? Personally, I do not believe so.” This week Lecornu wrote to trade unions promising to improve pension provisions for women. Trade unions said they instead wanted a suspension of Macron’s changes to the pension system, pushed through without a parliament vote in 2023, and a complete rethink."
world/2025/mar/15/trump-tariffs-are-reshaping-our-politics-canadians-on-their-election,‘Trump tariffs are reshaping our politics’: Canadians on their election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/15/trump-tariffs-are-reshaping-our-politics-canadians-on-their-election,World news,2025-03-15T11:00:48Z,"When the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, resigned in early January, after months of pressure to quit, the approval ratings of the progressive firebrand had dropped from their peak of 65% in September 2016 to 22%. At the end of last year, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, described by many as “Trump Lite”, was the clear favourite to win Canada’s next general election, and the top pick of 45% of Canadians for prime minister. At the time, the three biggest issues for voters were all economic: reducing the cost of everyday items, inflation and interest rates, and access to affordable housing. The first few weeks of Donald Trump’s second presidential term have changed some of that, at least for the time being. According to a new survey, “dealing with US president Trump” is now the most important issue influencing Canadian votes, ahead of the economy. Canadian polls point to a remarkable political shift: Poilievre’s predicted landslide victory appears to have vanished into thin air. His party is still predicted to win, and is still polling above its 2019 and 2021 levels of support, but Poilievre’s perceived proximity to Maga politics has boosted the centre-left Liberals to only a few points behind the Conservatives. “The tariffs imposed by Trump are reshaping our political landscape,” said Richard Nantel, a 65-year-old from Montreal, Quebec. “A pro-Trump Conservative party was predicted to win the upcoming federal election. This party is now scrambling to save what was a sure win. It’s now less likely that the Conservatives will win the election.” Scott Duncan, 54, a management consultant, said: “Since Trump began to threaten Canada with becoming the 51st state, the Canadians around me have become much more aligned politically.” Duncan is also from Quebec, the predominantly French-speaking province that has recently had a resurging separatist movement. “People like my mom’s partner, who were pro-Trump before, no longer are. I have been very surprised by the fierce Canadian nationalism displayed everywhere.” “Those that boasted to support Trump – colleagues at work – have quieted down for the meantime,” said Nicholas Mickelsen, a 35-year-old structural firefighter from Edmonton, the capital of Alberta – a province that has long been considered a Conservative fortress, and where the newly minted prime minister, Mark Carney, grew up. Nantel, Duncan and Mickelsen were among hundreds of Canadians who shared with the Guardian how they, those in their social circles and their communities had been grappling politically and privately with the US-Canadian trade war and political standoff. Markets have been reacting with gradually rising panic to retaliatory tariffs and rhetoric between the two North American neighbours, with many Canadians now bracing for a recession and worrying about their jobs and investments. Various people expressed growing concerns about China’s decision to impose harsh retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian farm and food imports last weekend, but despite these shock developments, the primary worry for many voters is now the US president. “Family and friends who are more to the right and left have come to the centre to fight Trump,” said Andrea, 59, a teacher from Toronto. Longtime Tories and leftwing New Democratic party (NDP) or Green voters in her social circle, Andrea said, had recently joined the Liberal party and were all planning to vote for Carney in the next general election. “Trudeau’s legacy is looking very different now,” she said, pointing to the outgoing prime minister’s remarkable popularity comeback over the past few weeks. Retired Fiona Mackey, 63, from Comox, British Columbia, had been planning to lend her support to the leftwing NDP, until Carney threw his hat in the ring. “I signed up to the Liberal party to vote for Carney to replace Trudeau, as I felt he would be the best person to steer us in the right direction with tariff threats, Trump, world stability, and so on,” she said. “A lot of Canadians haven’t yet heard of him, as he was ‘poached’ by the Bank of England. I like his views on the EU, and would be happy for Canada to join!” Mackey was among many Canadians who said they felt Poilievre and his Conservatives had merely “cashed in on Trudeau’s unpopularity” and “would not stand up to Trump”. “Anti-Trump sentiment”, she said, had united Canadians behind controversial politicians such as Doug Ford, the polarising, rightwing populist premier of Ontario who just won a third term after vowing to “fight against Donald Trump”. He was “universally very popular” now, Mackey felt, because he was “standing up to the US”. “I guess it’s ‘in the moment’ politics, he’s stuck his neck out for Canada. My west coast friends who are NDP-leaning like him for what he’s doing for Canada at the moment.” Katie, a mother of three from Ontario in her 40s, said that although there were still people sympathetic to Trump and his politics in her community, other voters seemed to be “rapidly returning to [their] comfort zone, which is a Liberal majority”. A recording of Ford admitting to caucus and supporters that he had been a Trump supporter until the trade war began seemed to reflect a broader sentiment in Canadian society among rightwing voters, Katie added. While many left-leaning Canadians who got in touch reported feeling relief that Trump had knocked some wind out of the Conservatives’ sails, various people pointed out that strong anti-Trump sentiment had allowed politicians to ignore other pressing issues and had helped beleaguered politicians with poor track records – such as Ford and Trudeau – regain popularity. “[Doug Ford] is taking an aggressive stance against Trump, and captured the focus of voters,” said Christina, in her 40s, a web design consultant from Ottawa. People had forgotten his cuts to education and a major property development scandal, she added. Like scores of others, she felt Ford had ruthlessly pounced on the opportunity to call a regional election in a rare moment of collective shock and unity for personal gain, and many predict Carney may seek to similarly capitalise on the anti-Trump mood and call an early election. While many shared renewed optimism about the Liberals’ chances of winning the election, others warned that many Canadians were still politically aligned with Trump’s overall vision. Stephen McIntyre, a pensioner living on a low-population island in British Columbia, said he was dismayed about the “so-called Conservatives who share Maga values and find support”, while the “real Conservatives” had “lost their political voice long ago”. “The threat of a Trump-sympathetic Conservative national government looms in the next election,” said Colin Martin, a university instructor from Calgary, Alberta. “Alberta’s current government has more in common – functionally and ideologically – with Trump’s administration than with our own national government, which has created significant tension here.” Alberta, home to most of Canada’s oil and gas production, is the country’s largest exporter to the US. According to a survey, 29% of Albertans would have voted for Trump, compared with 21% of Canadians. The Alberta premier, Danielle Smith, who accepted an invitation by Trump to Mar-a-Lago in January, has repeatedly cautioned against tariff retaliation, in sharp contrast with other Canadian leaders. “Donald Trump’s comments about Canada becoming the 51st state have overnight created advocacy groups for merging with America,” said John Bourassa, 42, from Vancouver. “There are debates on where new electoral lines should be drawn, if Canada should be a territory or a state.” Trevor*, a farmer from Saskatchewan who will be affected by the new 100% Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola oil, said the election of Trump had restored his faith in the wisdom of the average voter. “Personally, I am in favour of joining the US but pretty sure that’s not a majority position. A common currency is much less controversial. “I await the arrival of Poilievre as our new PM and his adoption of Trumpian policies to reduce waste in our government and other administration spending,” he said, hoping this would “help reduce the national overdraft”. “Mr Poilievre and the Conservatives will have a substantial majority in my constituency, I know nobody who will have changed their mind.” Although tariffs could mean “a temporary financial hit”, he thought a long-term benefit was “entirely possible”. Trevor was critical of “the ongoing belligerence on the part of Trudeau, Doug Ford and, of course, Carney” and feared that the markets, political opposition and “an almost wholly hostile press, worldwide” could totally derail Trump’s plans for the US and the west. Poilievre, Trevor felt, should continue with his “already effective” criticism of Canadian housing costs and housing shortages, and “should not distance himself from Mr Trump” or “say anything to devalue his standing” with the US president. While many respondents stressed that being proudly Canadian had been a sort of antithesis to Trump and the US for a long time, scores of people reported having fallen out with American family, friends and colleagues since Trump’s second term began, and feeling an unprecedented sense of hostility towards the US. Kelly Ann Grimaldi, 39, from Welland, Ontario, said her family in Canada and Italy had stopped speaking with most of their US family members, because even those who did not support Trump could not understand why Canadians did not want to be American. “I look at America as our enemy,” she said. “I find myself feeling a lot of anger at Americans I interact with, even though I understand that many of them will suffer much more than I will under this administration,” said Sarah, 26, a retail worker from Montreal. Assurances from Americans that they opposed Trump, she felt, were “self-serving” in the absence of action to support their Canadian neighbours. Pamela, a middle-aged professional from Ontario, said she had not bothered to vote in the last general election, as she had felt things had been “working just fine in Canada”. “This time, I definitely want to vote, on the issue of who will best deal with Donald Trump. I anticipate unprecedented turnout, since so many Canadians know that our nation and way of life are at stake.” *Name has been changed"
world/2025/sep/30/trump-gaza-proposal-peace-reactions-welcomed-world-leaders-palestinian-residents-remain-sceptical,Trump’s peace proposal welcomed by world leaders but Palestinians remain sceptical,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/30/trump-gaza-proposal-peace-reactions-welcomed-world-leaders-palestinian-residents-remain-sceptical,World news,2025-09-30T09:06:35Z,"Middle Eastern and European leaders have expressed cautious support for Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza, backing that was tempered by scepticism from some in the territory. The plan announced on Monday by Trump and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for an immediate ceasefire, an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas disarmament and a transitional government led by an international body. By Tuesday morning, Netanyahu was already walking back on the plan, including a clause that says Israel will not occupy Gaza and its military will withdraw completely. He said the army “will remain in most of Gaza”. Still, as the only US-backed option to end what a UN inquiry found this month was an ongoing genocide, the plan was welcomed in principle by leaders in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan and Egypt, who said they were ready to cooperate with Washington to ensure its implementation. It was clear, however, that Hamas remains a critical factor in whether Trump’s peace proposal gets off the ground. Experts and residents of Gaza said the absence of the group from negotiations and the plan’s demand that they renounce governance of the strip raised doubts about its viability. “It’s clear that this plan is unrealistic,” Ibrahim Joudeh told the AFP news agency from southern Gaza. “It’s drafted with conditions that the US and Israel know Hamas will never accept. For us, that means the war and the suffering will continue.” Abu Mazen Nassar was equally pessimistic, saying: “This is all manipulation. What does it mean to hand over all the prisoners without official guarantees to end the war? Hamas has lost us and drowned us in the flood it created.” The plan did receive backing from some allies of the US who last week formally recognised Palestine as an independent state. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called on Hamas to agree to the plan and “end the misery”, while France’s Emmanuel Macron said Hamas had no choice but to “follow this plan”. Even the Spanish government – which has been one of the most vociferous European critics of Israel’s offensive – welcomed the plan and urged both sides to commit to ending the violence. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she encouraged “all parties to now seize this opportunity”, while the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, an Israel ally, said the plan was the “best chance” to end the war. Diplomatic veterans of the Obama and Biden administrations also described it as a “good deal”. Brett McGurk, previously of the US national security council, said with Israel and the group of Arab and Islamic countries endorsing the plan, “all international pressure must now come down squarely on Hamas”. Barack Obama’s ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, said that while there were still a lot of details to be worked out, Trump’s plan was “credible”, adding: “Next step is to get Hamas to accept it, which requires strong pressure on them from Qatar and Turkey.” Under the details of the plan, a transitional authority – overseen and supervised by an international “board of peace” headed by Donald Trump – would take control of Gaza until the Palestinian Authority has completed a programme of “reform”. The authority, which is nominally in charge of Palestinian affairs in the West Bank, welcomed Trump’s efforts to end the war, and called for a comprehensive deal that would pave the way for a “just peace on the basis of [a] two-state solution”. The presence of the former UK prime minister Tony Blair on the “board of peace” raised eyebrows among many, with Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, saying: “We’ve been under British colonialism already.” “He has a negative reputation here. If you mention Tony Blair, the first thing people mention is the Iraq war,” Barghouti told the Washington Post. In Israel though, there was cautious hope that the nearly two-year conflict could finally be drawing to a close. In Tel Aviv, where protests calling for an end to the war and the return of hostages have been growing, Inbar Hayman said she was optimistic, but “afraid of being disappointed again”. Gal Goren, whose parents were killed during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, said: “We were very happy to hear what Trump said. We were happy to hear that Trump saw us, that he heard us calling for ending this war and bringing all the hostages … home.” Less than 75km (47 miles) south in war-torn Gaza, where at least 30 people were reportedly killed by Israeli strikes on Monday, some also dared to hope. Anas Sorour, a 31-year-old street vendor, told AFP: “Despite everything we’ve lived through and lost in this war … I still have hope. No war lasts for ever. This time I am very optimistic, and God willing it will be a moment of joy that makes us forget our pain and our anguish.” But after almost two years of war and countless attempts at ceasefire deals for Gaza, every new announcement is still met with suspicion. Mohammed al-Beltaji, a 47-year-old from Gaza City, summarised his views of the negotiations: “As always, Israel agrees then Hamas refuses – or the other way around. It’s all a game, and we, the people, are the ones paying the price.” With Agence France-Presse"
world/2025/nov/05/in-the-netherlands-rob-jetten-led-the-liberals-to-a-fragile-victory-over-populism,Lessons for liberals: what can Dutch progressives’ victory over populism teach the world? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/in-the-netherlands-rob-jetten-led-the-liberals-to-a-fragile-victory-over-populism,World news,2025-11-05T15:30:28Z,"So how do you beat the populist far right? Judging by the joyous reaction to D66’s victory in last week’s Dutch elections, the progressive-liberal party – and in particular its infectiously upbeat young leader, Rob Jetten – have discovered the secret. Although official results are not due until Friday, Jetten on Tuesday appointed a “scout” to sound out possible coalition partners after besting Geert Wilders’ anti-immigration Freedom party (PVV) by just 28,400 votes, out of more than 10m cast. Both parties will have 26 seats in the new Dutch parliament: a stunning achievement for D66, which had just nine in the last one, and a humiliating setback for Wilders, whose far-right party won a shock 37 in the previous 2023 election. If all goes according to plan, Jetten will become – after the month or six it generally takes to form a government in the Netherlands – the country’s youngest ever prime minister, at the head of a far more centrist, pro-EU government than the last one. But while there are certainly lessons to be learned for liberals from D66 and Jetten’s remarkable performance, they are far from universally applicable. And it would be very wrong to assume that the Dutch far right has been defeated. *** Optimism and a big tent Let’s see the glass as half full, though, and begin with what worked. Jetten was “the anti-Wilders”, Léonie de Jonge, a far-right expert at the University of Tübingen, told me, with a message voters hailed as “positive, calm and constructive”. Sarah de Lange of the University of Leiden agreed. D66 had been boosted by a “hopeful, confident, optimistic, can-do campaign” whose slogan was het kan wél – essentially a Dutch version of Barack Obama’s celebrated “Yes, we can”. Contrasted with the negativity of pretty much everyone else on the ballot, that really appealed. Simon van Teutem said Jetten sold hope but also “progressive patriotism”, and was “not afraid to take off the gloves” to confront the far right directly. Van Teutem also highlighted a point made by several commentators: rather than attacking fellow moderates on the relatively few policies on which they really differ, Jetten pitched a big tent in which voters from both left and right felt comfortable. *** Progressives fared badly So far, so good. You’re a progressive party facing off against far-right populists? Find yourself a fit, youthful leader with a big smile who oozes optimism and can-do spirit, and is prepared to stress policy overlaps, rather than differences, with potential allies. Is that enough? Unfortunately, probably not. Several intertwined specifics helped propel Jetten to his upset win. First, Dutch voters were emerging from almost a year of coalition talks, swiftly followed by another of near-total governmental dysfunction. The four-party, rightwing, PVV-led coalition formed after Wilders’ 2023 landslide was marked by vicious infighting and accomplished virtually nothing before he torpedoed it after just 11 months over its refusal to endorse his draconian immigration plans. Many voters were, unsurprisingly, peeved: all four parties in the outgoing coalition were punished: the PVV lost a third of its MPs, while New Social Contract (NSC) – somewhat ironically founded to promote good governance – went from 20 to zero. Second, the Netherlands’ highly proportional electoral system, in which 0.67% of the vote equates to one MP, encourages that high degree of volatility – and fragmentation. Fifteen parties made it into parliament, and D66 won with barely 17% of the vote. Third, the other progressives fared badly. The GreenLeft/Labour (GL/PvdA) alliance led by the former European Commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, shed five of the 25 seats it won last time to finish fourth – with many votes going to D66. Fourth, D66 didn’t play the progressive card anyway say political scientists Stijn van Kessel and Andrej Zaslove. The party prioritised a tougher stance on migration over issues such as the climate crisis, LGBTQ+ rights and EU integration. And finally, that bit about seeing off far-right parties? Well, fragmentation affected them too. The lost PVV votes mainly went to the conspiratorial Forum for Democracy (FvD, which went from three seats to seven), and marginally milder JA21 (one MP to nine). So overall, the far right did very well. “This is absolutely not peak populism,” de Jonge told me. “As a bloc, the far right gained a seat. Even Wilders didn’t blow it: the PVV’s score was its second highest ever. And now far-right ideas dominate Dutch politics.” *** Jetten’s coalition challenge So where does this all leave Jetten? To secure a majority in the 150-member parliament, he needs a coalition assembling 76 seats. The most likely is a four-way “grand” alliance spanning the political spectrum – but it will be hard to negotiate. Together, D66, the liberal-conservative VVD, GL/PvdA and the centre-right CDA (who, underlining voters’ frustration with governmental chaos, surged from five seats to 18 on the promise of a more “decent” and “responsible” politics) would have 86 MPs. Unfortunately, the VVD – which under its previous leader, the former prime minister Mark Rutte, often governed with more progressive parties – has said it will not go into coalition with the centre-left GL/PvdA, preferring instead a rightwing partner. The only realistic option for that would be JA21 – whose ideology is diametrically opposed to D66 on issues such as minority rights and climate change. Plus, a four-party formation with JA21 would fall one short of a parliamentary majority. Long, hard coalition talks await (in 2021-22, they took 299 days). Meanwhile, Geert Wilders will return to opposition, where, with no consensus needed, he is far more comfortable, to continue dominating Dutch debate – and dragging it to the right. So, lessons for liberals elsewhere? Be cheerful, upbeat and open to ideologically challenging coalitions, sure. But it helps if your political system is fragmented, voters volatile, the last government was a basket case, and everyone to your left does badly. And even then, you haven’t really beaten the far right. To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here."
world/2025/sep/12/jail-for-bolsonaro-by-no-means-signals-the-end-of-his-political-movement,Jail for Bolsonaro by no means signals the end of his political movement,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/12/jail-for-bolsonaro-by-no-means-signals-the-end-of-his-political-movement,World news,2025-09-12T04:00:27Z,"Four years have passed since Jair Bolsonaro laid out three possible denouements for his extraordinary political career, during which the oft-ridiculed fringe politician rose to become one of leading lights of the global populist right alongside Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump. “Going to jail, being killed or victory,” predicted Brazil’s then president as he grappled with a deluge of political crises in August 2021. Bolsonaro was right. A majority of Brazil’s supreme court judges found the 70-year-old guilty on Thursday of masterminding a failed military coup designed to stop the leftwing winner of the 2022 election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office. “Nowhere in the world … has complete immunity against the virus of authoritarianism that creeps in insidiously, distilling its poison to contaminate freedoms and human rights,” Justice Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha told a courtroom in the capital, Brasília, as she cast the deciding vote. Bolsonaro was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. Seven co-conspirators were also convicted, including the former head of the navy, Adm Almir Garnier Santos, three four-star army generals, and the former head of Brazil’s answer to MI6. The historic verdict – the first time a former Brazilian president has been found guilty of trying to overthrow the country’s democracy – appears to have extinguished Bolsonaro’s hopes of one day reclaiming the presidency of South America’s largest democracy. But experts and politicians from across the spectrum agree the former paratrooper’s political movement, Bolsonarismo, will continue to thrive despite the incarceration of its creator. Bolsonaro received more than 58m votes in the 2022 election and, despite his conviction, remains wildly popular with certain sectors of society, including the fast growing evangelical community, in Brazil’s agricultural heartlands and among members of the security forces and well-educated middle-class conservatives who loathe the left. Pro-Bolsonaro protests still draw tens of thousands of citizens on to the streets. “It might be the end of Bolsonaro but it is not the end of Bolsonarismo … Bolsonarismo will live on with or without Bolsonaro,” predicted Thaís Oyama, a columnist for O Globo newspaper and the author of a book about the former president. Guilherme Boulos, a leading leftwing congress member, said Bolsonaro’s downfall was an undeniable blow to the Brazilian right ahead of next year’s presidential election in which Lula will seek a fourth term. But would it snuff out Bolsonaro’s movement? “No,” Boulos replied emphatically during an interview in his congressional office overlooking some of the buildings vandalised by Bolsonaro supporters during their January 2023 rampage through Brasília. “The far right – in Brazil and around the world – has built a solid social base which goes well beyond the figure of Bolsonaro. “Bolsonaro is the leader of this movement in Brazil. But to claim his imprisonment will put an end to a certain kind of fascism of the masses that has been built on the defence of authoritarian, prejudiced, intolerant, xenophobic ideas, wouldn’t be true. That wouldn’t be reading the Brazilian reality as it is.” Boulos, 43, is widely viewed as an heir to the 79-year-old Lula. Bolsonaro is unlikely to be taken into custody for several weeks. It is unclear whether he will be sent to a regular prison or be jailed in a police or military installation. Already, though, minds are turning to which politician will inherit his votes in next year’s presidential election. Contenders include his senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, and the former first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, a charismatic born-again Christian popular with evangelical voters and conservative women. “People were electrified when Michelle came out to speak [at a recent rally in São Paulo]. She’s already a political celebrity,” said Camila Rocha, a political scientist who studies Brazil’s new right. “I’d say Michelle could turn out to be an Evita Perón of the Brazilian extreme right. She has the potential.” Others believe the smart money is on São Paulo’s rightwing governor, Tarcísio de Freitas, a former army captain who was infrastructure minister in Bolsonaro’s 2019-2023 administration. On the eve of this week’s verdict, Freitas lashed out at the judicial “tyranny” of the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes – a move clearly designed to appeal to orphaned Bolsonaro voters seeking a new leader. Oyama said that by radicalising his rhetoric, Freitas was trying to seduce those orphans and stop the right fragmenting after Bolsonaro’s incarceration, with hardcore Bolsonaristas siding with one of his relatives or another populist successor, and members of the conservative establishment backing another, less radical name. “Lula will without doubt win re-election if the right splits,” she predicted. Whoever emerges as Bolsonaro’s successor, Boulos expects next year’s election to be a gruelling battle for the left against a rightwing movement he believes will receive support from Donald Trump and US big-tech firms. Trump unsuccessfully tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial, claiming the prosecution was “a political execution” and a “witch hunt” designed to destroy his ally’s career. In the lead-up to this week’s judgement, Trump hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs and sanctioned Moraes. Asked about the situation in Brazil on Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters Trump was “unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America, to protect free speech around the world”. Boulos believes US pressure will continue in the lead-up to the 2026 vote, even with Bolsonaro behind bars. “We’re talking about the richest companies on the planet, the planet’s biggest billionaires, and the president of the most powerful nation on earth taking direct action in Brazil to favour the extreme right,” he said. “It’s going to be war.”"

A renowned expert in air quality and health, Morawska, of the Queensland University of Technology, began contacting international colleagues. She eventually gathered 239 scientists globally to highlight the risk of airborne transmission of Sars-CoV-2. The public pressure eventually prompted the WHO and other authorities to update their public health guidelines. For her work during the pandemic, Morawska was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people in 2021. On Monday evening, she also received the top gong at the Prime Minister’s Prizes for Science, for her “pioneering research about the air we breathe”. Morawska described receiving the $250,000 prime minister’s prize as “an amazing joy”, but said importantly the award would bring attention to her field of research. Her current work focuses on ultrafine particles – tiny pollutants tens to hundreds of times smaller than PM2.5 and believed to have more significant health impacts, but which are not yet widely regulated. “Because they are so small, they can get deep into the human respiratory tract,” Morawska said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Morawska’s recognition comes at a fraught time – an “age of anti-science”, as she has called it. “In the United States, it’s a particularly difficult situation,” she said. “Science and scientists are nowhere near as listened to as … in the past, and decisions are not based on science.” It is a problem she hopes to tackle by bringing scientists together as she did during the early years of the pandemic. “If we operate individually, it’s very easy to reject us … but eventually, the voice of a large scientific body, which can be respected, hopefully will make a difference.” The prime minister’s science prizes, now in their 26th year, are Australia’s most prestigious awards for achievements in scientific research, innovation and teaching. Anthony Albanese said in a statement: “I congratulate and thank Prof Morawska for her incredible work over many years which influenced how Australia and the world mitigated risks associated with Covid-19. “I extend that congratulations and thanks to all recipients.” In a category awarded for the first time this year, Prof Michael Wear received the prime minister’s prize for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge systems. Wear, a Malgana traditional custodian of Gutharraguda (Shark Bay) in Western Australia, received the $250,000 prize in recognition of his marine conservation work. He is the founder of Tidal Moon, Australia’s first Indigenous-owned and led sea cucumber fishery and marine restoration enterprise. Wear founded the enterprise several years after a marine heatwave in 2010-11 resulted in the loss of 22% of seagrass beds in Shark Bay. “When the seagrass died, we noticed that the sea cucumbers increased in size,” he said. “We built a free market enterprise … around sea cucumbers as a commodity to export.” Proceeds from the sale of those sea cucumbers, primarily in cosmetic products, funds the organisation’s seagrass restoration efforts, with 12 Indigenous divers trained to date. The firm plans to restore 20 hectares of seagrass beds next year. The minister for science, Tim Ayres, said he was proud the prizes “are now acknowledging and elevating the extraordinary contributions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have made and continue to make to science and our nation”. “Prof Michael Wear’s work exemplifies the ongoing importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge systems to peoples, communities and place,” Ayres said in a statement. “I’m happy to be the first [recipient],” Wear said, “but I don’t want to be the last.” Other prize recipients include Prof Yao Zheng of the University of Adelaide, recognised for his work in producing clean hydrogen directly from seawater; and Dr Vikram Sharma, founder of QuintessenceLabs, who was recognised for translating quantum science research into cybersecurity protections."
world/2025/nov/12/female-politicians-such-as-mexicos-claudia-sheinbaum-face-backlash-driven-by-discrimination,‘Attacked no matter what they do’: why female politicians face relentless cycle of abuse ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/female-politicians-such-as-mexicos-claudia-sheinbaum-face-backlash-driven-by-discrimination,World news,2025-11-12T09:00:19Z,"The brief and deeply unsettling encounter lasted just a few seconds, sparking outrage across Mexico and beyond. But for those who have spent years tracking women in politics, the incident in which a drunken man attempted to kiss Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on the neck and grope her was shocking but not entirely surprising. “It’s definitely part of a pattern,” said Zeina Hilal, of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the global organisation of national parliaments. “It’s really an illustration of what women in politics are facing.” In 2016, the organisation surveyed 55 female politicians from 39 countries about their experiences of sexism, harassment and violence. What they found was alarming; 82% reported experiencing psychological violence, a category that included sexist remarks as well as persistent and intimidating behaviour, while 44% reported receiving death threats or threats of rape or beatings. One in five of the women said they had been slapped, pushed, struck or hit with a projectile that could have injured them. The organisation has since spoken to hundreds of female politicians in regions across the world. While the job titles and positions varied slightly, their experiences were depressingly similar. “This violence is targeting women because they are women,” said Hilal, who manages the gender and youth programmes for the Geneva-based organisation. “It targets their bodies, it targets what society associates them with – so children, their physical characteristics.” She described the attacks as an attempt to question the role of women in leadership, an effort that at times was linked to a more formal push back against gender equality. “You have people who would do these things without this being their direct objective. They’re annoyed by these women who have power and the way in which women are present,” she said. “But there are definitely movements that exist, they are funded and know what they are doing. They even coordinate attacks online with bots and with people paid to carry out these attacks.” Among the women surveyed, the frequency of this violence varied; younger women, those from minority backgrounds or who have a strong stance on gender equality or human rights reported disproportionately higher rates of abuse. The findings dovetail with the steady stream of female politicians – spanning the UK to Canada and beyond – who have opted to leave politics, citing the toll that the increasing threats and harassment were taking on them and their families. Weeks before Sheinbaum was accosted, Sweden’s Anna-Karin Hatt, the leader of the Centre Party, said she was leaving public life, citing the constant threats and harassment. The announcement came three years after her predecessor, Annie Lööf, opted to do the same, after grappling with neo-Nazi threats, stalkers and online trolls. Some have sought to sound the alarm over the wider repercussions this could have for democracies. In 2023, former Dutch politician Sigrid Kaag warned that the online vitriol could roll back decades of progress when it comes to the political participation of women, minorities and people of colour, while the UK Conservative MP Dehenna Davison called for the torrent of “vile abuse” to be halted. “We need to do all we can to stop the brightest and best being turned off entering politics, or as a society we will all suffer,” she said on social media. While most of the research on political violence has relied on self-reporting, in 2023 researchers in Italy combed through more than a decade of data to establish whether female politicians were being targeted more often. The records of online and offline attacks against local mayors in more than 7,500 municipalities revealed an astonishing discrepancy, said Gianmarco Daniele, an associate professor at the University of Milan and one of the researchers behind the study. “So the probability of receiving an attack is almost three times higher, which is a massive difference.” They then compared mayors who were similar in every way but gender, seeking to control for factors such as policy decisions, performance and corruption. Again, a clear pattern emerged. “We see that the men are attacked more when they perform badly, while women are attacked no matter what they do,” he said. “So if they perform very well, they are attacked. If they perform badly, they are attacked. So this doesn’t seem to be driven by what they do in office, but seems to be just a kind of backlash driven by discrimination.” Those who were attacked were less likely to run for re-election, in a finding that could help to explain why women remain dramatically underrepresented in politics globally. “It’s crucial because the selection into politics often starts at the local level,” said Daniele. The violence offers a glimpse of how women’s presence in politics remains contested, conditional and at times unwelcome, said Adriana Marin, a lecturer in international relations at Coventry University. “It isn’t random or incidental,” she said in an email. “It targets women precisely because they are entering spaces historically dominated and policed by men.” This dynamic had burst into public view with the assault of Sheinbaum, she said. What took place on a public street in Mexico City was not merely an act of individual misconduct, but was also an assertion of power over a woman whose position challenges longstanding gendered expectations. “Threats or physical aggression, persistent undermining, sexualised harassment or efforts to delegitimise a woman’s authority – all these reinforce patriarchal boundaries,” she said. Perhaps nowhere is this more publicly visible than online. While male politicians receive similar amounts of online harassment, the content differs significantly, said Inessa De Angelis, a PhD student in the faculty of information at the University of Toronto. “Male politicians, the research shows, often receive comments that are more focused on their policy priorities and the policy positions they take, so they might receive backlash for their budget or their position on the economy or things like that,” she said. “Whereas with women, the attacks tend to be more on their personal characteristics and their perceived abilities based on those. So it’s often more sexist, often more vitriolic, and they might mention the members’ children, for example.” Researchers have described this as a double burden placed on female politicians, as they are forced to cope with a disproportionate amount of online toxicity while also wrestling with the broader question of what the attacks say about their place in politics. “It’s the kinds of comments that really make them question why they are in politics and undermine their ability to do their job,” said De Angelis. “So if we don’t take action both online and offline, it really will risk the ability to have more equal and inclusive parliaments.” Despite nearly a decade of reports and the steady succession of warnings from departing politicians, some continue to brush off the violence, said Hilal. “There are people who say, ‘you want to be a politician, you need to take it.’” This is a view that threatens to erode the very fabric of democracy, walling off politics for some and pushing away others. “Ultimately, political institutions are workplaces as well, where women and men work,” she said. “So if you wouldn’t accept it in other workplaces, why would it be acceptable in political institutions?”"
world/2025/apr/12/japans-world-expo-a-positive-vision-of-the-future-for-our-divided-world,Japan’s World Expo: a positive vision of the future for our divided world?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/japans-world-expo-a-positive-vision-of-the-future-for-our-divided-world,World news,2025-04-12T15:00:49Z,"As clunky as it sounds, “designing a future society for our lives” isn’t a bad ambition for the world in these troubled times. From this Sunday, organisers of the 2025 Exposition in Osaka will be hoping that appeal will put the event’s unsettled preparations in the shade for a six-month celebration of our common humanity. The western Japan city is preparing to host its second World Expo, 55 years after the first was held in a country eager to capitalise on fading memories of the second world war as it embarked on its postwar journey to become an industrial and technological powerhouse. Then, 64 million people descended on Osaka’s northern suburbs to view the Tower of the Sun – still a popular site in the commemorative park – and a moon rock retrieved by Apollo 12. The 2025 version opens under a geopolitical cloud dark enough to cast a shadow over the 960-acre grounds on the reclaimed Yumeshima (“Dream Island”), a former dumping ground for industrial waste and, for successive Osaka governments, a plot of land in perennial need of a purpose. The expo is the most convincing attempt yet to make use of the unloved island, until now a blot on the landscape, with Osaka’s industrial skyline on one side and the busy shipping lanes of the Seto inland sea on the other. In its mission to bring people together, 150 countries and regions will showcase the best of their culture and technology, albeit with an acknowledgment that humanity is more divided than at any time most of the millions of expected visitors can recall. They should, though, marvel at a Martian meteorite discovered by Japanese scientists in Antarctica in 2000, interact with androids that could one day live in their homes, view a beating artificial heart made of stem cells and – not for the faint-hearted – stare back at an image of what they might look like in 25 years’ time. Viewed from the grand ring – a 2km (1.24 mile) wooden promenade that encircles the waterfront site – there is an incongruity to the 150 pavilions, from the flamboyance of Turkmenistan to the neat wooden contours of Japan. And all separated by lots of Tarmac and concrete. The earthquake-resistant wooden “skywalk”, though, is a feat of craftsmanship, built with a traditional joinery method used in the construction of ancient shrines and temples, its network of cypress, cedar and pine beams destined to become a shady oasis when Japan unleashes its brutal summer heat midway through the event. The expo theme’s tagline – “towards a brighter future for all” – feels laughably elusive, but credit should go to the organisers for addressing the harsh realities of the world outside. The blue and yellow sign over Ukraine’s booth states that the country is “not for sale”, echoing comments from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia has chosen not to take part. In August visitors will be able to take part in a virtual reality experience corner for conflict zones in Gaza, in a space currently devoted to 80 years of the United Nations and its constituent departments and agencies, including Unrwa. Palestine’s space is to be found in the far corner of a shared pavilion, although its organisers claim the shipment of several planned exhibits has been delayed by Israeli authorities, which is denied by Israel, whose pavilion includes a stone from the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The reported delay is in keeping with Osaka’s bumpy road to Expo 2025. Construction was hit by labour shortages and the soaring cost of building materials – the project’s initial price tag of ¥125bn has soared to ¥235bn (from £666m to £1.25bn) – while interest among the Japanese public has so far been lukewarm. The 1970 Osaka Expo’s 64 million visitors was a record until Shanghai in 2010. So far, only 8.7m advance tickets have been sold for 2025, well below the pre-sales target of 14m. Last week, as TV crews swarmed around the site, workers were still flattening strips of tactile paving for visitors with visual impairments, while activity around incomplete pavilions gave them the feel of a supermarket tradesmen’s entrance. The 1,500 trees comprising the Forest of Tranquillity will need time to bed in. Organisers have been given last-minute jitters by the discovery of potentially explosive concentrations of methane gas, as well as concern about overcrowding at the new subway station serving the site and, on social media, disbelief at the lack of cubicle walls in the children’s lavatories. The host nation, though, has deployed its soft power to good effect: the world’s longest conveyor belt sushi, a giant Gundam robot, 32 sculptures of Hello Kitty dressed as different types of algae to symbolise the plant’s versatility, and an upgraded version of a “human washing machine” that proved a hit at the 1970 event. In a country addicted to yuru-kyara [mascot characters], the biggest attraction could turn out to be Myaku-Myaku, a red and blue figure with five googly eyes that was ridiculed when it was selected as the expo’s official mascot. Since then, the mysterious creature, purportedly “born from the fusion of cells and water”, has won over the Japanese public and is now the centre of a large merchandise empire … and the face of manhole covers across Osaka. Sou Fujimoto, the exposition’s architectural mastermind, conceded the event was opening at a time when minds are focused on wars, real and commercial. “The whole global situation is very unstable,” he told CNN. But he added: “I believe this is a really precious opportunity to show so many countries can come together in one place and think about our future together.” That lofty vision will be fleeting, however. The pavilions – and Fujimoto’s “sustainable” edifice – will be dismantled later this year to make way for Japan’s first casino. But as gambles go, the longer odds could be on selling the idea that the expo movement’s bricks-and-mortar appeal for global unity will strike a chord in a hyper-connected, but fractured, world."

Mette Frederiksen is hosting EU leaders in Copenhagen for talks on aiding Ukraine and firming up European defence projects intended to ensure the continent is ready to deter invaders by 2030. Urging unity, Frederiksen said all European countries were affected by the “Russian hybrid war”, whether through drone incursions or sabotage. “I hope that everybody recognises now that there is a hybrid war, and one day it’s Poland, the other day it’s Denmark, and next week it will probably be somewhere else that we see sabotage or … drones flying,” she told reporters on Wednesday. “I think we are in the most difficult and dangerous situation since the second world war.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who expressed solidarity with Denmark over recent drone incursions, struck a more restrained note: “We have to be strong to deter any aggressions, but we have to remain above all very cautious and avoid any escalation.” Macron said it was “a very good thing” France was investigating an oil tanker suspected of being part of Russia’s shadow fleet, but did not confirm a reported link between the vessel and drones over Denmark. In the run-up to two European summits this week, including a broader gathering of leaders on Thursday, Danish authorities closed airspace to civilian drones, after a spate of unidentified aircraft were spotted at airports. A German frigate arrived in the Danish capital over the weekend to boost air surveillance, while Sweden and France have also sent equipment and personnel. Noting that Denmark had not attributed responsibility for the unidentified drones, the European Commission president said she saw a pattern, citing drones in Poland and the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets. “This pattern is coming from Russia, in so far as Russia tries to test us,” Ursula von der Leyen said. Denmark, one of Ukraine’s staunch supporters, has been an early advocate of rearming Europe by 2030. In March, von der Leyen chose to flesh out her €800bn (£700bn) defence spending plan at the Royal Danish Military Academy in Copenhagen, where she endorsed the 2030 goal. In a paper to European capitals before Wednesday’s meeting, the commission said the EU needed to pursue two plans with “special urgency”: a “drone wall” to detect, track and shoot down such aircraft and a broader system to defend the EU’s eastern borders – on land, in the air and at sea – known as eastern flank watch. EU member states were urged to agree these broad plans by late October, as well as two other big joint projects, missile defences and a space “shield”. But leaders are divided over a €140bn reparations loan for Ukraine based on Russia’s frozen assets. The idea has gained momentum since the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, swung behind it last week, but France, Belgium and Luxembourg have doubts. “When assets are frozen, one has to respect international law,” Macron said on Wednesday, voicing his agreement with Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, who has said he is concerned his country could be left alone with the risk. Belgium and France hold stakes in the Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear, where €183bn Russian sovereign assets have been frozen since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “Taking Putin’s money and leaving the risks with us: that is not going to happen,” De Wever told local media last week. The commission believes it has a legally secure way to use the assets for Ukraine without touching Russia’s property rights. Under the plan, Ukraine would receive an interest-free EU loan that would be repaid once Moscow sent Kyiv reparations for the colossal damage inflicted during the war. Finland, Sweden and Ireland were among the countries to announce their support for the plan on Wednesday. The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, a longtime supporter of using Russia’s frozen assets to aid Ukraine, said her team wanted to move as fast as possible but acknowledged that not all member states supported the plan. She played down concerns the plan would damage investor confidence in the eurozone: “If you don’t start the war against another country, then you are out of the risk.”"
world/2025/aug/27/france-on-the-brink-political-crisis-economic-francois-bayrou,France on the brink: how a budget deficit became a political crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/france-on-the-brink-political-crisis-economic-francois-bayrou,World news,2025-08-27T14:17:49Z,"France is stuck in economic limbo, without a budget and soon, possibly, without a government. The prime minister, François Bayrou, has called for parliament to hold a confidence vote on 8 September and, now that parties of the left and far right have pledged to bring down the government, on paper he doesn’t have the numbers to win. On Tuesday, the Socialist party (PS) added its voice to the dissenters, allying it with the Greens and the far-right National Rally. In an effort to head off a no vote, the finance minister, Eric Lombard, has stated publicly that asking the global lender of last resort, the International Monetary Fund, to intervene “is a risk that is in front of us”. Without the Socialists, Bayrou’s centre-right administration cannot survive. And there is widespread agreement among economists that Bayrou’s fall will trigger further speculation about the health of the economy and the public finances. At first glance, France’s situation would appear to be far from dire. It is a pillar of the euro monetary system. The government’s debts are lower in relation to the size of the economy than those of Italy, and the cost of financing its annual debt interest bill is well below the UK’s. Yet while France’s debt to GDP ratio is lower than Italy’s 135%, Rome has a grip on its annual expenditure. Italy might suffer from low growth, but no lower than France’s, and the EU commission forecast is for an improvement next year. And for inflation to stay low. At the same time, the debt to GDP ratio is on course to fall from 3.3% this year to 2.9% in 2026, below the 3% stipulated by the commission. France, by contrast, is rapidly closing the gap with its neighbour after projections showed a persistent annual spending shortfall pushing the French debt to GDP ratio from 113% last year to more than 120% by the end of the decade. For international investors, it is less the size of the debt that matters than its trajectory. So while French debt interest costs are low, at 3.5% on 10-year bonds when the UK is coping with 4.7%, they are not as low as Italy’s. Even Greece outperforms France. According to European Central Bank data, Greece has a debt to GDP ratio of 158%, but pays only 3.36% on its 10-year bonds. The president, Emmanuel Macron, has tried to persuade the French people that the public finances need some major surgery but to no avail. He has warned against complacency, saying the “years of abundance are over”. Probably his most unpopular act so far is to push through a rise in the retirement age from 62, saying that higher pensions payments are a drag on the state’s finances and deny the economy skilled workers. Bayrou’s minority government aims to go further. It plans to save almost €44bn (£38bn), to bring down the budget deficit from last year’s 5.8% of GDP to 4.6% in 2026. One of its more contentious proposals is the scrapping of two French public holidays. The only rescue plan available appears to be re-formulating the budget to bring the Socialist party on side, though months of wrangling have made that seem a distant prospect. Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies, said that despite a fall in the value of French banks on the stock market today, there were few repercussions from higher debt costs of political instability for the French financial sector, at least in the short term. He said the political crisis was more a threat to economic growth than the solvency of the government. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected Bayrou to temper his demand for a reduction in the annual deficit as a way to save his administration. However, a higher deficit “would imply a further increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio and put potential credit rating adjustments back in focus”. This would bring with it a boost for the economy because “a smaller deficit reduction into next year would imply a smaller fiscal drag and be positive for growth, all else equal”, they said. “But the tightening in financial conditions and increase in policy uncertainty would likely be negative for growth. Taken together, we think that growth would likely continue to run at 0.6% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026,” they added. These figures will make grim reading for Macron, who pledged to develop a more vibrant, high-growth economy. With French polls showing there are few plans around which a majority of French people are willing to coalesce, a budget could be a long way off."
world/2025/nov/07/india-women-cricket-world-cup-win-victory-equality,Hit for six: why India’s Women’s Cricket World Cup win is victory for equality ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/07/india-women-cricket-world-cup-win-victory-equality,World news,2025-11-07T14:00:01Z,"Growing up in rural India, Shafali Verma always knew she had a hunger to play cricket. But in her small town of Rohtak, in the north Indian state of Haryana, cricket was not a game for girls. Aged nine, desperate to play, she cut her hair short, entered a tournament disguised as her brother, and went on to win man of the match. Verma’s determined father, Sanjeev, in the face of refusal from every cricket academy or training centre who would not accept his daughter, enrolled her as a boy. “Luckily, nobody noticed,” he recalled, as Verma made her debut for the national women’s team at 15 years old. On Sunday, Verma stood triumphantly with her teammates as they held aloft the Women’s Cricket World Cup, making history as the first Indian women’s national team to win the cup – and for equality. The struggles and sacrifices made for years by the women to get here – defying social stigma, a lack of resources and juggling manual jobs between training – made their win even more extraordinary. It came at a critical turning point for women’s cricket in India, where the sport verges on a national religion, is a multibillion dollar industry but also widely regarded as a “gentleman’s game”. It was only in 2017 that female cricketers were given full-time professional contracts and a women’s premier league (WPL) established in 2023. Varnika Choudhary, who plays for the Uttar Pradesh state under-23s women’s team, described how her small village of Beerakheri had always been very resistant to her playing cricket and it had taken two years to convince her parents to let her play. Even as the cricket-crazy village regularly gathered to watch the Indian premier league (IPL) and Men’s Cricket World Cup, women’s professional cricket was widely ignored. But this time, said Choudhary, the whole village sat in the square to watch the Women’s World Cup final on Sunday. “Everyone in my village got so excited when they won,” she said. “They were all sending me photos and reels and messages saying: ‘This will be you winning for India one day.’” Many in her village had been particularly impressed by Verma’s batting. “They told me, wow she’s hitting like a man,” said Choudhary. “I had to correct them and say, no she’s hitting like a woman.” Hundreds of millions of people across India tuned in to watch the final and Choudhary was among the many who saw the win as a pivotal moment, not just for women’s cricket but for women in India more broadly, and their battle for equality in the country’s still deeply patriarchal society. Though more women in India are being educated, they endure heavy societal burdens on how they are expected to behave and present themselves in public and are uniformly lower paid across all sectors. “More women playing cricket changes everything, not just in the sport,” Choudhary said. “We feel independent, we feel we are doing something for ourselves and that society can finally see us equal to the men.” Sharda Ugra, one of India’s foremost cricket writers, said the significance of the match went beyond cricket. “For Indian women in the public space, your body is usually seen as a source of honour or shame,” she said. “So to see these girls – who mostly come from rural small towns – running around, sweaty, shouting, screaming and uninhibited about what they looked like, sent a very powerful message. It was quite wonderful to see.” The national team, led by the captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, have become Indian sporting royaltyafter their win, and this week were hosted at the residence of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The significance of their triumph for women in India was widely acknowledged by the team, who paid tribute to the female cricketers who had paved the way before them. Without this trophy, said Kaur after the match, “the revolution, the change we want, won’t come”. Ugra said she believed the win would trigger “a mass movement towards making cricket a sport that girls play for leisure, for enjoyment, as a profession”, but emphasised that women’s cricket still had a long way to go in India to catch up with the IPL, a franchise valued at about $18.5bn (£14bn). There are only five teams in the WPL and the resources and cricket academies available for young women are still limited, especially in rural regions. Women’s cricket in India also does not have its own governing body, falling instead under the men’s. At a cricket academy in Delhi’s Gargi college, the impact of the win was already being felt. Standing on the pitch in her cricket whites with her hands on her hips, 11-year-old Kiera Kareer said she was more motivated than ever to play for the national team one day. “This winning match proved to everybody that women’s cricket is as good as men’s, they played very smoothly,” she said. “We can hit as hard and we can run as fast. In fact, I think they played better than the men.” A few years ago, Spreeha Maurya, now 18, was the only girl attending this academy and had spent years playing with boys. The coaches, so determined to get girls into the sport, had initially let Maurya play for free. “It was so inspiring and motivating to watch the final, and see the stadium completely packed and everyone screaming and cheering when they won. I had never seen people react to women’s cricket like that before,” said Maurya. “I think winning this World Cup has solidified it in our mind that women can do everything and it’s not a gentleman’s game any more.” Standing on the sidelines, her father, Rudal Maurya, 54, said when he had first brought his daughter to state trials, there had only been about 40 girls – this year there were about 500 who attended. Looking around at the field, where girls as young as six stood in the batting nets, his eyes welled up. “The mindset is changing, so many more parents will bring their girls for training now, and that can change the society,” he said. “My daughter is so passionate about cricket. It is the dream of our whole family that one day, she too will play for India.” Additional reporting by Aakash Hassan"
world/2025/aug/06/world-awaits-trump-next-move-as-russia-ceasefire-deadline-approaches,World awaits Trump’s next move as Russia ceasefire deadline approaches,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/world-awaits-trump-next-move-as-russia-ceasefire-deadline-approaches,World news,2025-08-06T14:53:33Z,"After taking six months to conclude that Vladimir Putin may not be a kindred transactional authoritarian leader but an ideological nationalist seeking the return of what “belongs to Russia”, the deadline Donald Trump set for the Russian president to agree a Ukraine ceasefire or face US sanctions on oil exports arrives on Friday. What Trump – who some had claimed was a Russian asset – does next to punish Putin could define his presidency. It is a remarkable turnaround and one that seasoned Trump watchers such as Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, said they had never expected. Only months ago the debate was about what further inducements Trump would offer Putin to end the fighting. His administration has not introduced any sanctions against Russia, compared with at least 16 sets of actions in every prior six months back to February 2022, according to a report submitted to the Senate banking committee by top Democrats this week. Trump first set Putin a 50-day deadline then cut weeks off it. “Secondary sanctions and tariffs against China, India and Brazil, which buy Russian oil, are the obvious next step in an attempt to stop the conflict,” the US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, predicted on Tuesday. But as the deadline approaches, there is lingering scepticism about how far Trump will go. He has dispatched his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to Moscow for the fifth time for last-minute talks and on Friday Trump admitted he did not think sanctions would have much impact as Russians are “wily characters and pretty good at avoiding sanctions”. He has also given himself maximum room for political manoeuvre by ensuring the US Senate did not pass legislation before its summer recess that would have empowered him to slap bone-crushing 500% tariffs on exports from countries that import Russian oil, principally India, China, Brazil and Turkey. Trump had argued that the congressional legislation was unnecessary as he can act through executive orders, mentioning instead 100% tariffs on economies that import Russian oil – a whopping number, even if lower than the 500% floated by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham. It is striking that in the run-up to Witkoff’s talks in Moscow that Trump, normally keen to tout his leverage before a negotiation, has given only sketchy detail of the punishments the importers of Russian energy may face, either in terms of US sanctions on foreign refineries importing Russian oil or US tariffs on countries importing Russian oil. Some of Trump’s warnings this week to the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, that he would raise tariffs on India because its government did not care “how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine” do not yet seem to fit into a wider strategy. The tensions appears as much about Trump’s previous complaints with India’s trade practices as its purchases of cheap Russian oil. They are due to start on August 27. Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Century, said if India was to receive a penalty but China – the largest buyer of most Russian crude – did not, the Russian oil trade may just go further underground. Some of Trump’s advisers, notably the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, warned China last week of tariff hikes related to Russia energy purchases, but it is hard to see such threats as credible given Trump’s eagerness for a trade deal with China and the risks associated with a sudden stop to trade between China and the US. In 2024 China accounted for 32% of Russian petroleum and oil exports. McFaul told Foreign Policy magazine about a possible boomerang effect if generalised increases in tariffs turn into a full trade war. Trump has wavered about the impact of economic pressure on Putin. Many academics say that sanctions on oil reshape economic relationships and change markets rather than produce changes in state behaviour. Three years of sanctions on Russia have so far been – at best – a slow burn. Russia chalked up economic growth of 4% in 2023 and 2024, kept unemployment to an astonishing 2%, and even reduced social inequality by sustaining real wage growth that has disproportionately benefited Russians at the lower end of the economic ladder, a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based thinktank, found. The authors predicted that Russia’s economy can withstand the current level of sanctions for at least three more years. But the report also pointed to developing vulnerabilities in Russia. Interest rates are at 18%, inflation stubbornly high and growth is stalling. Russia has had to rework its 2025 budget as oil revenues slipped, largely because of a fall in prices and the discounts importers such as India could demand. As a result, government revenues from Russian oil and gas in May-June were 35% lower than the same period in 2024, the Kyiv School of Economics said in its July review. Russian oil export revenue is projected to drop 16% from $189bn (£142bn) in 2024 to $163bn in 2025 and $151bn in 2026. The federal budget deficit reached 3.7tn rubles ($40.4bn) in the first half of 2025 – 97% of the full-year target of 3.8tn rubles. This is more than five times larger than the deficit in the first half of 2024 and 57% higher than the largest first six-month deficit in recent years (2023). Oil prices are unlikely to recover significantly, meaning Russia will miss its budget target by a wide margin, increasing reliance on its national welfare fund (NWF) and domestic debt issuance. The NWF’s liquid assets are also under pressure, with Russia expected to draw heavily on these reserves by year end. In a report this week, Oxford Economics predicted that Russia “may tip into recession”. The overall reason is simple: the level of military spending, including the cost of voluntary recruitment is distorting the economy. The economist Janis Kluge, who conducts research on Russia at the Berlin thinktank SWP, thinks overall Russian military spending is 8 to 10% of GDP once all expenditure including regional recruitment is included. The pressure could grow. The EU’s most recent sanctions package included a ban from next January on buying oil products made from Russian crude. The package for the first time put sanctions on a big Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, causing Microsoft this week to suspend software services. Other refineries could be placed under sanction – with the UK likely following suit – but the question then arises as to how the supply gap created by the loss of Russian oil can be filled. Moreover, if Trump is joining sanctions, the US and Europe will have to come to a joint decision on the continuing value of the elaborate oil price cap, a Biden-era device designed to squeeze Russian oil profits while keeping the global price of oil low. The cap was introduced across the G7 in December 2022 and operates by withdrawing insurance from any shipping company that has not obtained a certificate that it is selling Russian oil below $60 a barrel, but a multitude of problems have arisen. In recent months, as the price of oil has fallen, it’s become evident the $60 cap was set too high. The cap has also led to the birth of a shadow fleet of oil tankers operating without formal insurance that are now being sanctioned by the EU, the US and the UK. The UK and the EU have agreed to lower the price cap from 2 September to $47.60 a barrel, but Trump is keeping the US cap at $60 a barrel, a recipe for circumvention. The one prerequisite is that Trump must not back off, McFaul said. “Making threats and not carrying through with them is one of the biggest mistakes you can make in diplomacy.” The former ambassador recalled George Shultz, the great Reagan-era US secretary of state, saying “never point a gun at anyone unless you are prepared to shoot”."
world/2025/sep/19/for-comedians-around-the-world-the-laughs-often-end-as-democracy-fades,"For comedians around the world, the laughs often end as democracy fades",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/19/for-comedians-around-the-world-the-laughs-often-end-as-democracy-fades,World news,2025-09-19T06:40:10Z,"The exiled Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef has experienced firsthand how intolerant governments can silence political satire. And he had a short message this week for those living in an age of Donald Trump’s free speech clampdown: “My Fellow American Citizens,” he wrote on X. “Welcome to my world.” In his attacks on the most prominent of American satirists, the US president has joined a cadre of illiberal and sensitive leaders around the world who will not tolerate a joke. The latest target of what critics say is a campaign to silence dissenting voices was Jimmy Kimmel, who had his late-night ABC talkshow suspended after government pressure. The removal, weeks after the rival network CBS cancelled Stephen Colbert’s satirical show, follows other Trump-led crackdowns on media and academia. Political foes of the US president say the diminishing space for free speech shows Trump’s America is moving towards authoritarianism. Senator Bernie Sanders, speaking to MSNBC, said the country was on a path towards becoming more like oppressive regimes in Russia and Saudi Arabia. “This is just another step forward,” he said. From Egypt’s military ruler, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to India’s populist prime minister, Narendra Modi, the laughs often end for comedians as democracy dwindles. One of the most famous global comedians to have his life turned upside down by his political satire is Youssef, who first found fame with a TV show panning the Egyptian regime. Known as the “Egyptian Jon Stewart” in reference to the US talkshow host whom he was inspired by (and looks like), Youssef is a former heart surgeon who became a household name. But his satire made him the target of two opposing governments. He was first arrested in April 2013, accused of insulting Islam and Egypt’s then president. Months later, when Sisi took power by force, Youssef had to cancel his show and flee the country. Youssef has said his struggle was as much against Egypt’s cloying, conservative culture as its repressive leaders. “We didn’t have a space for satire in Egypt. We carved out our own space. We had to fight for it,” he said in a 2015 interview. “And because there’s no platform, no space or infrastructure for that kind of satire to be accepted, we were basically pushed out … We are up against generations of people who don’t have this kind of mindset. That’s why it was an uphill battle for us.” Comedians elsewhere have often found themselves caught up in nationalist fervour. In India, which has a history of a lively and relatively free public discourse, critics of Modi argue space to criticise the policies of his rightwing nationalist government is shrinking. Comedians and comedy venues have increasingly been caught in the crosshairs since the rise of his Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which has ruled for more than a decade. A Muslim comedian was detained by police for weeks in 2021 for allegedly vulgar jokes insulting Hindu gods – despite never having performed at the show. The comedian Vir Das faced a backlash later the same year and police reports filed by BJP officials after a monologue that dealt with the country’s contradictions on women’s rights and religion. Police in Mumbai registered a criminal case against a comedian in 2017 over a tweet of a photo of Modi modified by Snapchat’s popular dog filter, giving him a canine nose and ears. Similar cases have come out in Russia, including a standup of Azerbaijani origin and a citizen of Belarus, Idrak Mirzalizade, who was detained for 10 days and later banned from the country for a joke about open racism in Russia. Comedy, it seems, can also be treated by some as a transnational crime. The Turkish government asked for the prosecution of a German comedian in 2016 for performing a satirical poem about its president. In the late-night programme screened by the German state broadcaster ZDF, Jan Böhmermann sat in front of a Turkish flag beneath a small, framed portrait of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, reading out a poem that accused the president of repressing minorities and “kicking Kurds”. Erdoğan’s lawyer Michael Hubertus von Sprenger wanted to enforce a complete ban on the poem, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor at the time, was widely criticised for appearing to give in to Ankara’s demands. Böhmermann said at the time he felt Merkel had “filleted me [and] served me up for tea” to Erdoğan, and that she risked damaging freedom of speech in Germany. Charges brought against him were later dropped and he was given police protection."
world/ng-interactive/2025/feb/18/europes-population-crisis-see-how-your-country-compares-visualised,Europe’s population crisis: see how your country compares – visualised,https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/feb/18/europes-population-crisis-see-how-your-country-compares-visualised,World news,2025-09-03T08:42:04Z,"Anti-immigration politics is on the rise across Europe. France’s National Rally and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) each have significant representation in their country’s legislatures, meanwhile the UK’s Reform party is topping the polls. But the rise of the far-right could speed up the population decline of Europe, projections show, creating economic shocks including slower growth and soaring costs from pensions and elderly care. Those wanting to shut Europe’s borders must contend with a stark demographic reality: the continent’s native population is expected to fall sharply over the next century in an era of low birth rates. Experts warn that European societies will age more quickly without immigration, bringing forward a host of economic challenges as workforces shrink and care burdens grow. “Most politicians on the centre-left and centre-right recognise that immigration is needed to ease demographic pressures,” said John Springford, an associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank. “They have sought to focus on tougher – and often inhumane – asylum rules in the hope that stricter border enforcement will provide political cover for higher regular immigration. “But radical right parties are increasingly challenging the mainstream consensus. Those countries that manage to hold the line against demands to cut working-age immigration will be in a stronger position economically in the long run.” The latest projections produced by Eurostat, the EU’s official statistics agency, suggest that the bloc’s population will be 6% smaller by 2100 based on current trends – falling to 419 million, from 447 million today. But that decline pales in comparison with Eurostat’s scenario without immigration. The agency projects a population decline of more than a third, to 295 million by 2100, when it excludes immigration from its modelling. Eurostat’s baseline projections assume countries will maintain their average net migration levels from the past 20 years, but the Guardian has examined figures also published by the agency with this assumption left out. Likewise, the UK’s Office for National Statistics publishes population projections that include a zero net migration scenario. Italy, France and Germany, where anti-immigration politicians have recently made inroads, would face big population declines in a zero-immigration scenario. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has made cracking down on migration a priority in her first term, but her country has one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe and its population would more than halve by the end of the century under zero immigration. In Germany, where the anti-immigration AfD came second in this year’s federal election, the population could shrink from 83 million to 53 million over the next 80 years if its borders were completely closed. And in France, where the National Rally won the first round of legislative elections last summer after campaigning for restrictions on incoming people, a zero-immigration scenario would mean a population fall from 68 million to 59 million. Only a handful of EU states would notice little difference from closed borders: Romania, Latvia and Lithuania, all countries that have experienced a net outflow of people. Instead, in most of Europe, populations would not only shrink in the absence of current immigration levels, but also become older as the number of working-age people fall relative to elderly people. Today, 21% of the EU population is aged 65 or over. In Eurostat’s baseline scenario, this proportion will rise to 32% by 2100, but in the agency’s zero-immigration scenario, it will increase further, to 36%. Those studying Europe’s changing age pyramid say this will put countries under increasing economic pressure. “The main consequences will be slower growth because the labour force will shrink, and higher tax burdens, because pension spending and the demand for health and elderly care will rise,” said Springford. Indeed, much of the EU is already seeing this, with tax burdens – as expressed through tax revenue as a percentage of GDP – climbing in counties such as France, Italy, Germany and Spain in recent decades. The health and social care industries will become increasingly important for managing an ageing Europe, and many health systems in the EU are already dependent on immigrant doctors or nurses. “More people are going to require care, though that does depend on how healthy people are in old age, and how much care they need,” said Alan Manning, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics. “You also have the other side of the equation that because of fewer children, because of low fertility rates, you need fewer people in education and childcare. So what we need to be doing, in some sense, is redistributing people who were caring for children to caring for old people.” At the same time, experts stress that immigration is not a silver bullet for Europe’s demographic challenges, instead suggesting it is one of many solutions, or at least a way to ease the transition to an older society. “Increasing immigration levels will not solve these demographic problems on their own – the levels required to do so would be very large, and there are only so many migrants who are willing to move,” said Springford. “But they would help, as would raising employment rates of working-age people, pushing back the age of retirement, reforming pensions and shifting the burden of taxation from labour income to wealth, especially property.” Manning added: “For immigration to help, it’s got to be that immigrants are actually in work, and many European countries have quite low employment rates among a lot of immigrants. So you can’t take that as a given. If you had an immigrant who came in and didn’t work and then needed support, for welfare, that wouldn’t make things better, that would make things worse. So it’s really important that they’re going to be in work, and that has been problematic in some cases.” Within national borders, rural areas will bear the brunt of the EU’s coming population decline. Over the next 80 years, more villages could suffer the same fate as Camini in southern Italy. The village is one of many in the Calabria region where the population declined sharply later in the 20th century as younger residents moved elsewhere for opportunities. Camini has recently become the site of a project that is resettling refugees, in an attempt to bring the community back from extinction. It was cited in a recent Council of Europe report written by the Labour MP Kate Osamor that examined the potential of immigration to alleviate the challenges of an ageing population. “I was watching the place slowly dying. The houses were just falling down because no one was living in them,” said Rosario Zurzolo, who was born in Camini and is now the president of the cooperative running the resettlement project, Eurocoop Servizi. So far, 50 refugees have settled permanently in Camini under the scheme, bringing the village population to 350, while a further 118 refugees are being temporarily hosted. A symbolic achievement for the scheme was the recent re-opening of the local school. Zurzolo says Camini can act as a model to help revitalise other European regions experiencing population decline. Serena Franco, who is also part of the Camini project and presented evidence to the Council of Europe for its report, added: “They’re bringing knowledge, and now we are starting to grow with them and to make new things, new processes, new jobs as well that would be impossible without them.”"
world/2025/nov/18/centre-left-tipped-to-lose-copenhagen-for-first-time-in-electoral-history,Centre-left tipped to lose Copenhagen for first time in electoral history,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/centre-left-tipped-to-lose-copenhagen-for-first-time-in-electoral-history,World news,2025-11-18T05:00:25Z,"The centre-left could lose control of Copenhagen for the first time in the city’s electoral history as residents of the Danish capital go to the polls amid growing disillusionment with the divisive politics of the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. Frederiksen’s Social Democrats have ruled the city for more than 100 years - producing every lord mayor that the municipality has had since the current system was introduced in 1938. But on Tuesday, as Denmark votes in municipal and regional elections, polls suggest the most probable result is a loss for the party’s candidate, a former government minister understood to have been handpicked by the PM. Among the reasons cited by analysts are fatigue and frustration with Frederiksen’s hardline policies on issues such as integration and immigration, which have partly inspired a new asylum and migration policy unveiled by the British government. Bent Winther, a political commentator at the Berlingske newspaper, has described the Copenhagen mayoral race as “more open than ever”, noting: “The rustling of history’s wings can be heard approaching city hall.” Polling earlier this month by Megafon for TV2 had the Green Left (Socialistisk Folkeparti, known as SF), the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) and the Alternative (Alternativet) in a position to form a left-leaning majority without the support of the Social Democrats. If this proves correct, among those being tipped to become Copenhagen’s next lord mayor is Sisse Marie Welling from the Green Left. The Social Democrat candidate, Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil, a former social affairs and housing minister, is a friend of Frederiksen, with whom she co-owns a summer house. Karoline Lindgaard, the mayoral candidate for green party the Alternative, said: “The Social Democrats have shifted rightward politically, becoming a rightwing populist party on agendas such as integration, unemployment support and the environment. “This was a cynical strategic manoeuvre to avoid losing voters to the far right, but it seems, based on polling, that all they have done is prime their own voters to join the far right rather than stay with the Social Democrats.” Many Copenhageners, she said, felt that the Social Democrats had “let the city down” - citing the 2020 departure of long-standing lord mayor Frank Jensen, who resigned after sexual harassment allegations. Lindgaard added: “They are on track to worsen the housing crisis, fail the city’s climate goals and further a car centric urban-paradigm.” Peter Thisted Dinesen, a political science professor at the University of Copenhagen, said it was “very likely” the Social Democrats would lose the capital – as the party’s anti-elite rhetoric may have alienated many in larger cities. In recent years, Frederiksen has sought to see off the threat of the far right by appealing to working-class voters in rural areas. Although it will vary across the country, Dinesen expects the government’s waning popularity to “rub off” on Social Democrat candidates more broadly. “There is maybe a bit of fatigue with the Social Democrat government,” he said. “They are increasingly being challenged by other parties. In particular, the Danish People’s party has really amped up their stances on immigration and remigration.”"
world/live/2025/oct/13/france-political-crisis-lecornu-macron-sarkozy-ukraine-russia-gaza-europe-news-latest-updates,French political crisis continues as Macron blames rivals for ‘sense of disorder’– as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/13/france-political-crisis-lecornu-macron-sarkozy-ukraine-russia-gaza-europe-news-latest-updates,World news,2025-10-13T14:16:47Z,"France’s political crisis rumbled on throughout Monday, with parliament bracing for a showdown over Sébastien Lecornu’s new government and fresh calls for the National Assembly to be dissolved. National Assembly president Yaël Braun-Pivet welcomed the appointment of Lecornu’s cabinet and appealed for “calm and constructive debate” ahead of a crucial week for the embattled prime minister, but her call was drowned out by a flurry of no-confidence motions and recriminations. Marine Le Pen and far-right leader Éric Ciotti announced a rare alliance on the right, submitting a joint motion of censure on behalf of their parties – the National Rally and the Union of the Right for the Republic. In a joint statement, they said France faced “an unprecedented political crisis” and urged Macron to invoke article 12 of the constitution to dissolve parliament, calling it “the most effective and democratic way to lead our country out of the deadlock.” Mathilde Panot, leader of the left wing France Unbowed (LFI), announced that her party had “just filed a motion of no confidence that will bring down Lecornu’s new government,” adding: “The country has no time to lose. Lecornu will fall and Macron will follow.” Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella accused the Socialist Party of cutting “backroom deals” with the government to avoid backing a no-confidence vote, warning that those who “prolong the way Emmanuel Macron is damaging our country” would be held accountable. President Emmanuel Macron accused his political opponents of fuelling unrest and destabilising his government. “The political forces in parliament which voted out [former prime minister] François Bayrou and the political forces that sought to destabilise Sébastien Lecornu are solely responsible for this sense of disorder [in France],” Macron told reporters in Egypt, where he is attending the Gaza peace summit today. And that’s all from me, Matthew Pearce, for today. The far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has accused France’s Socialist party (PS) of striking covert deals with the government to avoid backing a no-confidence vote against Emmanuel Macron’s administration. Speaking outside his party’s Paris headquarters, Bardella claimed the Socialists were “wheeling and dealing in the corridors of Matignon to try to buy themselves off on pension reform” rather than standing by their principles. “The PS must come out of the shadows. Are they with Emmanuel Macron or are they in opposition? This is the moment of truth,” he said. “We can’t keep going like this, hiding behind backroom arrangements,” Bardella continued. “Those who choose to prolong the way Emmanuel Macron is damaging our country will have to answer to the French people.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday hailed the “extraordinary” Gaza ceasefire as bringing hope that US president Donald Trump could broker an end to the Russian invasion of his country, AFP reports. “When peace is achieved for one part of the world, it brings more hope for peace in other regions,” Zelenskyy said on social media. He added: “If a ceasefire and peace have been achieved for the Middle East, the leadership and determination of global actors can certainly work for us too, in Ukraine.” A nine-year-old girl has been found dead at her home in Sarreguemines, northeastern France, in what prosecutors believe was a suicide linked to school bullying. Regional education officials said they were “shaken by this tragic event,” while prosecutors confirmed an investigation was under way. Former prime minister Gabriel Attal expressed his condolences, writing on social media: “Bullying is a scourge, a slow poison that erodes self-confidence and can lead to the worst.” President Emmanuel Macron has accused his political opponents of fuelling unrest and destabilising his government, as France faces one of its deepest political crises in years. “The political forces in parliament which voted out [former prime minister] François Bayrou and the political forces that sought to destabilise Sébastien Lecornu are solely responsible for this sense of disorder [in France],” Macron told reporters in Egypt, where he is attending the Gaza peace summit today. “At this moment in time, France is being watched. And the message it must convey is one of stability and strength. And so, it is everyone’s duty to work towards stability. Not gamble on instability,” he added. “I’m not making any bets,” Macron said. “I want the country to move forward.” France is heading for its biggest wheat stockpile in two decades as a collapse in demand from Algeria and China narrows export options, despite merchants profiting from slow Russian shipments to grab sales to Egypt and Asia, analysts said. The lack of French exports to Algeria and China in the past year due to diplomatic tensions with Algiers and Beijing cutting overall imports, means the EU’s biggest wheat producer now faces a surplus of 4 million metric tons annually, Reuters reports. That demand gap and global oversupply have pushed wheat prices towards five-year lows, squeezing French farmers already under pressure from cheaper eastern European rivals. Sébastien Lecornu has thanked the country’s armed forces in a farewell message posted on social media, praising their “commitment and courage” and calling higher defence spending “essential” to national security. Lecornu, who briefly returned to the defence ministry after his first short-lived resignation as prime minister, said he was leaving the post “with a sense of duty fulfilled” after more than three years overseeing France’s military modernisation. He paid tribute to soldiers killed in service and urged the armed forces to continue adapting to a “harsher world,” saying their mission remains vital “so that France remains France.” The Dutch government addressed a potential risk to both Dutch and wider European economic security when it took control of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, taking it out of China’s Wingtech hands, a European Commission spokesperson said on Monday. “We recall that protecting technology security is a priority of the EU’s Economic Security Strategy. And going forward, we would continue engaging with the Dutch authorities as we look at next possible steps,” the spokesperson told reporters. The Dutch government said it made the move due to worries about the possible transfer of crucial technology to Wingtech. Preliminary results from Kosovo’s weekend municipal elections showed most key municipalities heading to runoffs, highlighting the country’s ongoing political fragmentation — and underscoring continued tensions in Kosovo-Serbia relations. Most major Albanian-majority municipalities, including the capital Pristina, appeared headed for a runoff, according to the preliminary results released Monday. In contrast, all but one of the majority ethnic Serb municipalities were won by the Srpska Lista, the dominant Serb party seen as closely aligned with Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic, AP reported. About 2.1 million voters in the small Balkan nation voted Sunday for mayors for 38 municipalities and about 1,000 seats on town councils. Election officials said preliminary turnout was 40%, less than four years ago and the parliamentary polls earlier this year. According to the Central Election Commission, 21 municipalities will proceed to a runoff to be held on 9 November after no candidate secured more than 50% of the vote, the threshold required to win outright. In other news, German investigators and banking watchdog BaFin have shut down over 1,400 illegal domains in eastern Europe that were involved in cybertrading fraud, officials said in a joint statement on Monday. Dubbed Operation Heracles, the probe was conducted by Baden Wuerttemberg state criminal police and BaFin, Europol and Bulgarian authorities in an effort to crack down on those facilitating the use of fraudulent trading accounts, Reuters reported. Users of the websites were directed to brokers operating from call centres abroad who would encourage them to invest large sums. For many it took months to notice that their money was not being invested, the authorities said. “The perpetrators are becoming increasingly professional,” said Birgit Rodolphe of BaFin. “They use artificial intelligence to churn out illegal websites and use them to lure investors into traps.” This operation follows a previous shutdown of 800 illegal domains in June of this year. There have since been 20 million attempts to access them. “The measures significantly weakened the criminal actors by specifically disabling their technical infrastructure,” the authorities said. Portugal’s far-right Chega party has been dealt a sharp setback in municipal elections, winning just three mayoralties out of 308, far below the 30 it had predicted after its surge in national politics earlier this year. The result marks a steep fall from Chega’s 23% share in May’s parliamentary election, which made it the country’s official opposition. On Sunday, its vote share dropped to about 12%, with the party finishing behind independents and even the Portuguese Communist party in total mayorships. The ruling centre-right Social Democratic party (PSD) emerged strongest, securing 136 municipalities, including Lisbon and Porto, up from 114 four years ago. The centre-left Socialists won 128. Chega’s leader, André Ventura, admitted the results were disappointing. “Today we took a first step in that direction, but we are still far from that goal,” he said, arguing that building local roots was key to future national power. Read the Guardian Europe correspondent Jon Henley’s report here: National Assembly president Yaël Braun-Pivet has welcomed the appointment of Sébastien Lecornu’s new government, calling for calm and constructive debate as parliament prepares to convene. “Our institutions are strong and now ready to work in the interests of the French people,” Braun-Pivet said on social media. “Posturing and political manoeuvring must give way to constructive discussion before the National Assembly. Let the parliamentary debate begin!” France’s prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has unveiled a new government just two days after being reappointed, in a bid to restore order after one of the most turbulent weeks of Emmanuel Macron’s presidency. The reshuffle, announced late on Sunday, mixes senior civil servants with political veterans – several of whom had already been named in Lecornu’s first, short-lived cabinet. That lineup collapsed after only 14 hours amid public and political backlash, forcing the 39-year-old prime minister to resign and plunging Paris into crisis. Among those staying on are Gérald Darmanin as justice minister, Amélie de Montchalin at the budget ministry and Jean-Noël Barrot as foreign minister – all centrists close to Macron. Roland Lescure, another Macron ally, keeps the economy and finance brief and faces the daunting task of pushing through a 2026 budget while reining in France’s mounting deficit. Lecornu is due to present the fiscal plan on Monday before outlining his priorities in parliament later this week. The new cabinet also includes Catherine Vautrin, a conservative and former health and labour minister, who becomes defence minister. Conservatives Annie Genevard and Rachida Dati remain at agriculture and culture respectively – a decision that prompted their party, Les Républicains, to expel them after its leadership voted against joining the government. Paris police chief Laurent Nunez replaces Bruno Retailleau as interior minister, while former SNCF rail boss Jean-Pierre Farandou becomes labour minister. Lecornu described his lineup as a “mission-driven government” tasked with producing a budget before year’s end. “Only one thing matters: the interests of the country,” he wrote on social media. Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy will learn today when and where he will begin serving a prison sentence for criminal conspiracy in a scheme to fund his 2007 presidential campaign with money from Libya. The 70-year-old, who has consistently denied wrongdoing, will meet the National Financial Prosecutor’s Office (PNF) in Paris for what officials described as a short, procedural appointment. The PNF will tell him “the date, the place and the hour he has to be there,” said spokesperson Bérénice Dinh, adding that details will not be made public to avoid media intrusion. Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012, became the first former president in modern French history to be sentenced to prison when a Paris court handed him a five-year term on 25 September. The judges ruled the sentence should take immediate effect, citing “the seriousness of the disruption to public order” caused by the offence. He is expected to serve time under special security conditions, likely in a segregated wing of La Santé prison in Paris. Once incarcerated, he may appeal for release, with judges given up to two months to rule on his request. Sarkozy was cleared of three other charges. The court found no direct evidence that Libyan funds were used in his 2007 campaign or for his personal gain, though it said he had “prepared corruption at the highest level” while serving as interior minister and presidential candidate between 2005 and 2007. Sarkozy has long argued he is the victim of political retribution, claiming the case stems from his role in the 2011 military intervention that helped topple Libya’s leader Muammar Gaddafi. Read the Guardian’s Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis’ analysis of Sarkozy’s sentence here: EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said on Monday that Russia is “gambling with war” after a series of drone and fighter jet incursions into EU airspace, AFP reports. Nato has stepped up air defences along its eastern flank, accusing Moscow of testing allied responses with repeated drone crossings and a recent jet incursion into Estonian territory. “Every time a Russian drone or plane violates our airspace, there is a risk of escalation,” Kallas said during a visit to Kyiv, calling for Europe to turn its economic strength into “military deterrence.” Politico Europe is reporting that four French MPs from across the political spectrum will today submit a cross-party bill on proportional representation. The cross-party group includes Erwan Balanant from the centrist MoDem, Jérémie Iordanoff of the Greens, Marie Récalde from the Socialist Party, and Guillaume Gouffier-Cha from Renaissance, Macron’s party. According to Politico’s Playbook Paris newsletter, the bill is intended to show that “there is a way out of the institutional crisis” gripping France, rather than to put pressure on prime minister Sébastien Lecornu ahead of his policy speech. In a rare show of unity on the French right, Marine Le Pen and Éric Ciotti have submitted a joint motion of censure – the French equivalent of a motion of no confidence – on behalf of their parliamentary groups, the Rassemblement National (the National Rally) and the Union of the Right for the Republic (UDR). Announcing the move on social media, Le Pen and Ciotti confirmed the motion had been officially lodged with the National Assembly. “In addition to the security, migration, economic and budgetary crises, our country has been in an unprecedented political crisis under the Fifth Republic since the beginning of September,” read a statement. “In this situation, we must turn our attention to the constitution. It is clear that invoking Article 12, and therefore dissolving the National Assembly, is the most effective and democratic way to lead our country out of the deadlock.” Donald Trump has warned that the US could send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles if Moscow fails to end its war, signalling a potential escalation in Washington’s stance towards Vladimir Putin. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday after a call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump said: “I might say, ‘Look, if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks.’ The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.” Zelenskyy described the conversation as “very productive,” saying the two leaders discussed strengthening Ukraine’s air defences and long-range capabilities. “We work on it,” he told Fox News, when asked whether the weapons had been approved. The Kremlin responded sharply. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the proposal was a matter of “extreme concern,” while former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned that supplying Tomahawks “could end badly for everyone,” claiming Moscow would be unable to distinguish between conventional and nuclear missiles. “How should Russia respond? Exactly!” Medvedev wrote on Telegram, in what appeared to be a veiled nuclear threat. Russia has dismissed reports that one of its submarines was in distress after surfacing off the coast of northern France, insisting the vessel was simply following routine navigation rules. Nato’s Maritime Command last week shared photos of a French navy frigate tracking a Russian submarine near Brittany, saying the alliance maintained “constant vigilance and maritime awareness across the Atlantic.” The images prompted speculation after a Telegram channel known for leaking Russian security information claimed the Novorossiysk submarine had suffered serious technical problems, including a fuel leak. On Monday, Russia’s Black Sea Fleet denied the claims, saying the diesel-powered submarine had surfaced “in accordance with international navigation rules” while transiting the English Channel after operations in the Mediterranean. Speaking from Egypt, French president Emmanuel Macron dismissed opposition calls for his resignation, insisting he would remain in office to safeguard the country’s stability. “Never forget that the mandate given by the French people is to serve, to serve and serve, and to provide answers to the questions of everyday French people, and to do everything possible for the independence of France,” Macron told reporters in Sharm el-Sheikh. “That is the only thing that matters. The rest is the government’s business … I will continue to ensure stability,” he added. France’s political crisis has entered a volatile new phase after prime minister Sébastien Lecornu unveiled his new government on Sunday night – just two days after being reappointed. The reshuffle, intended to steady the ship after last week’s chaotic collapse of his first cabinet, has instead reignited tensions across the political spectrum and left president Emmanuel Macron facing the gravest challenge of his second term. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen declared that her the National Rally party and its allies will move to bring down the government, announcing a motion of no confidence in parliament. She urged Macron to dissolve the National Assembly and call new elections “to allow the French people to express themselves and choose a new majority for change.” Mathilde Panot, leader of the left wing France Unbowed, said her party had filed its own no-confidence motion “that will bring down Lecornu’s new government”. “The country has no time to lose,” she added. “Lecornu will fall and Macron will follow.” The threat piles further pressure on an administration already struggling to command authority after Lecornu’s record-short tenure and a wave of anger over his cabinet choices. The turmoil coincides with another seismic moment for France’s political establishment: former president Nicolas Sarkozy will today learn when he will begin serving a prison sentence for corruption. Macron himself will be busy however, joining European leaders heading to Egypt today for the Gaza peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh. The French president will be joined by Keir Starmer, Giorgia Meloni, Pedro Sánchez along with Donald Trump and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to discuss the ‘peace summit’ in Gaza. I will bring you all reactions here. It’s Monday, 13 October 2025, I’m Matthew Pearce, and this is Europe Live. Good morning."
world/2025/aug/22/donald-mcpherson-navy-pilot-dies,US’s last surviving second world war flying ‘ace’ dies aged 103,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/22/donald-mcpherson-navy-pilot-dies,World news,2025-08-22T19:09:06Z,"The second world war pilot who was believed to be the US’s last surviving “ace” – a title he earned by shooting down five enemy combatants – has died. Donald McPherson was 103 when he died on 14 August, according to his online obituary. McPherson fought Japanese forces during the second world war’s final years, serving in the Pacific theater as a US navy fighter pilot aboard the USS Essex. He earned the Congressional Gold Medal, three Distinguished Flying Crosses and recognition as an “ace” fighter for his service. Pilots had to shoot down at least five enemies in aerial combat to be recognized as aces. According to both the American Fighter Aces Association and the Fagen Fighters WWII Museum, McPherson was listed as the US’s last living ace from the second world war era. McPherson’s daughter, Beth Delabar, acknowledged the attention paid on her father’s military accomplishments – but said he preferred to be known as a pious man who was dedicated to his family as well as community. “When it’s all done and Dad lists the things he wants to be remembered for … his first thing would be that he’s a man of faith,” Delabar told the Beatrice Daily Sun, the newspaper in McPherson’s home state of Nebraska that first reported his death. “It hasn’t been till these later years in his life that he’s had so many honors and medals.” McPherson was 18 when joined the US navy in 1942, after Japan’s December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. He completed an 18-month training program before marrying his wife, Thelma, in 1944. He then belonged to fighter squadron VF-83, combating the Japanese in the F6F Hellcat planes that he flew. Once, in a Fagen Fighters WWII Museum video celebrating him, McPherson described how he shot down two Japanese planes in one mission. He said he noticed the planes converging, and he dispatched one into the ocean by lowering his fighter’s nose and firing. “Then I did a wingover to see what happened to the second one,” McPherson remarked on the video. “By using full throttle, my Hellcat responded well, and I squeezed the trigger and it exploded. Then I turned and did a lot of violent maneuver to try to get out of there without getting shot down.” He explained that a fellow sailor back at the aircraft carrier pointed out a bullet hole about a foot behind where McPherson had been sitting in the plane. As the Associated Press noted, McPherson’s daughter, Donna Mulder, interpreted that kind of experience during his military career as evidence that “maybe God is not done with me”. McPherson settled down at his family’s farm in Adams, Nebraska, after the war. He started youth baseball and softball leagues in Adams while accepting leadership positions for local institutions, including a scout troop, American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars chapters and a United Methodist church congregation. Adams eventually named a ballfield after McPherson and Thelma, who preceded her husband in death and was a scorekeeper and concession stand worker during games there.

world/2025/sep/13/universities-around-the-world-cut-ties-with-israeli-academia-over-gaza-war,Universities around the world cut ties with Israeli academia over Gaza war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/13/universities-around-the-world-cut-ties-with-israeli-academia-over-gaza-war,World news,2025-09-13T06:00:59Z,"A growing number of universities, academic institutions and scholarly bodies around the world are cutting links with Israeli academia amid claims that it is complicit in the Israeli government’s actions towards Palestinians. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 63,000 people have been killed in the territory – the majority of them civilians – with the true toll likely far higher. UN-backed experts have confirmed parts of Gaza, much of which has been reduced to rubble, are now in a “man-made” famine. In response, a growing number of academic bodies are now distancing themselves from Israeli institutions. Last year the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil cancelled an innovation summit with an Israeli university, while a host of universities across Norway, Belgium and Spain have cut ties with Israeli institutions. Others, including Trinity College Dublin, followed suit this summer. The University of Amsterdam has ended a student exchange programme with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the European Association of Social Anthropologists has declared it will not collaborate with Israeli academic institutions and has encouraged its members to follow suit. While not all those taking action support a general academic boycott, the movement reflects concerns over links within Israel between academia, the military and the government. Stephanie Adam of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said Israeli academic institutions are complicit in “Israel’s decades-long regime of military occupation, settler colonial apartheid and now genocide”, adding there is “a moral and legal obligation for universities to end ties with complicit Israeli universities”. However, few institutions in the UK, France and Germany have announced they are cutting links Israeli academia, with Universities UK (UUK) saying it does not support an academic boycott. “As a representative body, Universities UK has a longstanding public position of being committed to the free exchange of ideas, regardless of nationality or location. As such we do not endorse blanket academic boycotts, as this would represent an infringement of academic freedom,” a UUK spokesperson said. Likewise, the Royal Society has stated that it opposes academic boycotts. The Nobel laureate and former president of the Royal Society Venki Ramakrishnan told the Guardian he has mixed feelings about boycotts. “On the one hand, the Israeli government’s approach to Gaza has been hugely disproportionate, harming civilians, including young children, in the thousands,” he said. “On the other hand, most Israeli academics I know, including several I count as my friends, detest Netanyahu and his government. A boycott of this would penalise those who are not responsible for the actions of the Israeli government, and who in fact are very sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians.” The Israeli historian and political scientist Ilan Pappé disputed that many academics are sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians. “If it were so, I would have seen them among the few hundreds [of] brave Israelis who demonstrate against the war because it is a genocide, not because it fails to bring back the hostages (demonstrations that [are] regarded [as] illegal in Israel),” he said, adding that the vast majority of Israeli academics do not refuse to serve in the country’s army. “They provide courses and degrees to the secret service, police and are agencies of the government that are oppressing daily the Palestinians,” he said. On the academic boycott, Pappé said: “[It] is a very harsh and tough, albeit necessary, conversation with the Israeli academic institutions, illuminating for them their responsibility and for being an organic part of an oppressive system. A reality that has been going on for 77 years and the Israeli academia is now told that there is price tag attached to such a conduct.” Ghassan Soleiman Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian surgeon and rector of the University of Glasgow, said that students and academics across the UK have pushed for academic boycotts of Israel, but are being blocked by the governing bodies of universities. As a result, he said, researchers are taking unofficial action. “The moral outrage about what the Israelis are doing is leading more and more academics to take personal decisions, not to have joint projects with Israelis,” he said. Whether the severing of academic ties has had any impact on researchers in Israel, or the Netanyahu government, is a matter of debate, with some sources within Israeli academia stating it is not affecting their research or links with longstanding collaborators. However, that could change should the movement continue to spread, with experts noting the importance of collaborations between Israeli institutions and both Ivy League and western European universities. What’s more, blocks on research funding could be very problematic, both for Israeli universities and the country as a whole, given the Israeli economy is heavily based on science and technology. Such fears are very real: since 2021 Israel has received a net sum of €875.9m (£740.4m) from the EU’s Horizon Europe programme for scientific research. However, in July the European Commission proposed partially suspending Israel from Horizon Europe. “The proposal will affect Israeli entities participating in the EIC Accelerator, targeting startups and SMEs [small and medium enterprises] with disruptive innovations and emerging technologies that have a potential dual use, for example in cybersecurity, drones, and artificial intelligence,” said the EU Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier. At present, the suspension looks unlikely, with 10 member states arguing it is better to keep a dialogue open with Israel. But concerns remain that Israel could be blocked from the successor to Horizon Europe, which is set to begin in 2028. Adam said there are signs academic actions are cutting through, noting in May 2024 the Israeli government allocated €22m (£19m) specifically to combat the Palestinian-led academic boycott, while Israel’s share of EU research funding has fallen. Last Thursday it was revealed that of the 478 early-career researchers selected by the European Research Council to receive its 2025 starting grants as part of the Horizon Europe programme, just 10 are in Israel, compared with 30 of 494 grantees the year before. Should the money stop flowing and prestigious collaborations dry up, there is also concern that researchers will leave Israel, potentially never to return, fuelling a “brain drain” that is already a concern in medicine. While Israeli researchers told the Guardian academia is the wrong target for boycotts, and some experts say on its own an academic boycott will not be effective, others maintain the approach is a powerful tool. “The threat of academic boycott is sufficient to push the Israeli government into ending this genocide,” said Abu-Sittah."

I had the honour of serving with Ghanaian, Nigerian and Sierra Leonean soldiers in west Africa in 1999-2000 and they remembered, with pride, their forefathers’ campaigning in Burma; rightly so – the battles in the Arakan in 1943 were some of the hardest fought in the war. Far less honourable has been successive British governments’ refusal to treat African veterans, who fought so bravely for us, equitably. At the end of their service, African veterans were awarded a settlement one-third of that given to British soldiers or white settlers from Africa: it was straightforward racial discrimination. Few of those veterans are still alive, but their families and communities are, and they should receive the upgraded payments, suitably adjusted for inflation. Labour, when in opposition, cheerfully hammered the Tories over this issue. Now they are in power, on the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, it is time to set right this wrong.

world/2025/apr/01/tuesday-briefing-,Tuesday briefing: How Le Pen’s conviction could reshape National Rally – and French politics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/tuesday-briefing-,World news,2025-04-01T05:56:49Z,"Good morning. Marine Le Pen appeared to have been expecting a guilty verdict in her trial for embezzling millions in European parliament funds to pay her party’s workers in contravention of the rules – and even to have anticipated that she might face a period of ineligibility for political office once her inevitable appeal was over. But as she stormed out of a French court yesterday, shaking her head and muttering “incroyable”, it was clear that she wasn’t expecting this. The judge found Le Pen guilty along with 24 other members of her far-right National Rally party. But whereas a sentence under house arrest and fine were suspended pending the end of her appeal, a five-year ban from public office kicked in immediately. That means she will be ineligible for the 2027 presidential election in which she has been the frontrunner for months. The decision is a huge moment in French politics – and, while Le Pen said last night that she was “not going to let myself be eliminated like this”, there is a strong likelihood that it brings her candidacy to an end. Less clear is whether the news is a hammer blow to the far right’s cause, or a galvanising moment that could sweep her replacement into office. For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Jon Henley, the Guardian’s Europe correspondent based in Paris, about the charges, the sentence and what happens next. Here are the headlines. Five big stories US politics | Stock markets in Europe and Asia fell heavily on Monday after Donald Trump suggested that new tariffs he is expected to announce this week would hit “all countries”. In the UK, ministers are expecting to be hit by the tariffs, despite having hoped to secure a carve-out. Israel-Gaza war | Fifteen Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, including at least one United Nations employee, were killed by Israeli forces “one by one” and buried in a mass grave eight days ago in southern Gaza, the UN has said. Housing | Only 2.5% of private rented homes in England were affordable for people on housing benefit last year, with charities warning that more people will be pushed into rent arrears and homelessness as a freeze on the benefit takes effect. Taiwan | China has launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan, accusing its leaders of being “separatists” and “parasites” who were pushing the democratically run island into war. The drills, accompanied by a propaganda campaign, were launched without warning on Tuesday morning. Space exploration | Whatever Elon Musk and Donald Trump liked to insist, astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita Williams were never stuck, nor stranded in space, and definitely not abandoned or marooned, they told the world on Monday. The pair had to stay on the international space station for nine months instead of 10 days after a prototype space capsule had a propulsion fault. In depth: Will Le Pen’s conviction strike a blow to the far right in France – or boost it? There is a possible route back for Marine Le Pen: if she successfully appeals before the early 2027 deadline to register her candidacy for the presidential race, she could theoretically still run. But French legal experts do not expect the process will have concluded by then. National Rally (RN) – notorious as the National Front in its earlier, more explicitly extreme, incarnation – may decide that it is not worth the risk of waiting for her. Her shot at the presidency has therefore probably evaporated – perhaps meaning the beginning of the end of a political career in which she has managed to maintain her far right positions on immigration while persuading voters that she is more palatable than her father, Jean-Marie. Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s right-hand man in RN, certainly spoke yesterday as if her candidacy was over: “Today it is not only Marine Le Pen who was unjustly condemned,” he said. “It was French democracy that was killed.” Now, Jon Henley said, Le Pen faces a choice: “Does she accept the verdict, campaign on behalf of Bardella as her replacement, and accept that her moment has passed – or does she fight it, push the narrative of ‘activist judges’, and try to bring the French political order crashing down?” *** What were the charges? The case concerned National Rally using European parliament funds between 2004 and 2016 to fund party workers with no role in the Strasbourg legislature. RN was critically short of funds for most of that period, and according to prosecutors, set up a “war machine” to embezzle the funds by falsely claiming its staff were assistants for members of the European parliament. Prosecutors cited emails and other records showing that some of the workers with no role at the European parliament were employed in jobs from bodyguard to private secretary in France. The arrangement cost European taxpayers at least €4m (£3.35m). Angelique Chrisafis sets out more detail in this analysis piece. Le Pen insisted that she had “absolutely no sense” of having broken the law. But the judge agreed with prosecutors that she had played a central role in the scheme. “The evidence was pretty damning,” Jon said. “You had people being paid by the European parliament who never once set foot in Brussels. One of them was the Le Pen family chauffeur. The judge made very clear that she was, if not the instigator, at the centre of this system.” *** Why did the verdict disqualify her from office? The charges could theoretically have seen Le Pen banned from seeking office for even longer – up to 10 years. Prosecutors sought a five-year ban, and the judge agreed, saying: “The court took into consideration, in addition to the risk of reoffending, the major disturbance of public order if a person already convicted … was a candidate in the presidential election.” While Le Pen’s ban is among the most significant such sentences handed down recently in France – because she remains a crucial political player – as a matter of law it is not unprecedented. Former president Jacques Chirac got a two-year suspended sentence in a 2011 corruption case. Former president Nicolas Sarkozy was banned from public office for three years in 2023. And in 2004, Alain Juppé, who was expected to be a centre-right presidential candidate, was barred from public office over a 1980s party financing scandal. “The irony is that Le Pen spoke in favour of the law that means she’s now ineligible,” Jon said. “Legally the disqualification appears completely sound, and French courts have not been shy of condemning politicians in the past. But even if you see this as the correct legal decision you may be nervous about the political fallout. The court was in an invidious position.” *** How have politicians responded? After the sentence was handed down, far-right figures across Europe expressed outrage. (Jon has a summary of all the reaction here.) In Italy, the deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini called the ruling a “declaration of war by Brussels”. The Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders said he was “shocked” by the verdict. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister, said: “I am Marine!” In the Kremlin, meanwhile, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the verdict was evidence that “more and more European capitals are going down the path of violating democratic norms”. Donald Trump compared the case to his own legal travails, as did Elon Musk. Perhaps more interesting were the responses of Le Pen’s domestic opponents, because they suggest where they think the political incentives lie. While some, like Marine Tondelier, leader of the Greens, said the verdict was simply a case of a politician being “just like any other person subject to the law”, others appeared to be wary of appearing to exult in the removal of a major rival. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, of the leftwing La France Insoumise (LFI) party, said that “the decision to remove a politician from office should be decided by the people”. And Laurent Wauquiez, a mainstream conservative MP who may be the presidential candidate for Les Républicains, said: “I think that political debates should be decided at polling stations.” *** How will the French public respond? Recent opinion polls have shown Le Pen as the clear frontrunner for the 2027 election. Bardella, a 29-year-old member of the European parliament, is a high-profile but inexperienced likely replacement. “He has been groomed to be prime minister, but within the party most people accept that he’s too young,” Jon said. “He’s popular with their voters, but among members and in the hierarchy he’s seen as a bit too big for his boots.” Ashifa Kassam has a profile of him here. Some in the party have complained more should have been done to work out a contingency plan in case of Le Pen’s disqualification. “It’s a bit amateurish,” one National Rally lawmaker told Politico recently. “There is not a depth of talent in the party, and they are not particularly well-organised,” Jon said. The crucial unknown is whether the inevitable argument that the verdict is an establishment stitch-up resonates beyond the far right’s traditional supporters. “Their base are already pretty wound up by the idea that the system is against them, partly because of the history of the republican front,” Jon said, referring to the longstanding history of mainstream rivals co-operating to keep extremists out of office. “But it’s difficult to exaggerate how much Le Pen has sought to present herself as restrained and moderate for the last decade, and for either her or her party to abandon that in favour of attacking judges – that would be a big test of where the voters who flirt with supporting her now stand.” *** What will the decision mean for French politics in the meantime? Le Pen sits as an MP, and the conviction does not force her to stand down from that role – although it prevents her seeking re-election. But there may be more immediate consequences for France’s fragile parliament, where the prime minister, François Bayrou – an ally of the president, Emmanuel Macron – runs a minority administration. “She could bring the government down quite easily,” Jon said. “All she would have to do is table a motion of no confidence that she was confident the far left would support, or back a motion of theirs.” Until now, with a geopolitical crisis concocted in Washington and Moscow consuming France and Europe’s political energies, “there has been a sense that swing voters would consider it irresponsible to choose that route”, Jon said. “But Le Pen will now be considering whether her supporters are indignant enough to change that calculus.” What else we’ve been reading The artist Jeremy Deller can’t really draw or paint; as he has said himself, instead of making things, he makes things happen. Charlotte Higgins’s superb profile for the long read makes a compelling case for his distinctive kind of genius. Archie Author Rachel Connelly is fascinating in this column on “heteropessimism”, or, the generally pervading sense that something is wrong in dating between men and women. Most interestingly, Connelly concludes it may mostly be an invention of social media. Charlie Lindlar, acting deputy editor, newsletters The historian Timothy Snyder is persuasive on why Donald Trump’s expansionist bloviating over Canada and Greenland is a strategic error: “Musk and Trump are creating the bloodily moronic situation in which the US will have to fight wars to get the things that, just a few weeks ago, were there for the asking”.

world/2025/oct/22/jewish-notables-open-letter-un-sanction-israel,Jewish figures across the globe call on UN and world leaders to sanction Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/jewish-notables-open-letter-un-sanction-israel,World news,2025-10-22T10:00:49Z,"Prominent Jewish figures around the world are calling on the United Nations and world leaders to impose sanctions on Israel over what they describe as “unconscionable” actions amounting to genocide in Gaza. Over 450 signatories, including former Israeli officials, Oscar winners, authors and intellectuals have signed an open letter demanding accountability over Israel’s conduct in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The letter’s release comes as EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday amid reports they plan to shelve proposals for sanctions over human rights violations. “We have not forgotten that so many of the laws, charters, and conventions established to safeguard and protect all human life were created in response to the Holocaust,” the signatories write. “Those safeguards have been relentlessly violated by Israel.” Signatories include former speaker of the Israeli Knesset Avraham Burg, former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy, British author Michael Rosen, Canadian author Naomi Klein, Oscar-winning film-maker Jonathan Glazer, US actor Wallace Shawn, Emmy winners Ilana Glazer and Hannah Einbinder, and Pulitzer prize winner Benjamin Moser. The signatories urge world leaders to uphold international court of justice (ICJ) and international criminal court rulings, avoid complicity in international law violations by halting arms transfers and imposing targeted sanctions, ensure adequate humanitarian aid to Gaza, and reject false claims of antisemitism against those advocating for peace and justice. “We bow our heads in immeasurable sorrow as the evidence accumulates that Israel’s actions will be judged to have met the legal definition of genocide,” the letter reads. The appeal follows a sharp shift in public opinion for US Jews and the wider electorate over the last few years. A Washington Post poll found that 61% of US Jews believe Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza, and 39% say it is committing genocide. Among the broader American public, 45% told the Brookings Institution they believe Israel is committing genocide, while a Quinnipiac survey in August found half of US voters share that view, including 77% of Democrats. Other signatories to the letter include the Israeli conductor Ilan Volkov, playwright V (formerly known as Eve Ensler), American comedian Eric André, South African novelist Damon Galgut, Oscar-winning journalist and documentarian Yuval Abraham, Tony award winner Toby Marlow and Israeli philosopher Omri Boehm. “Our solidarity with Palestinians is not a betrayal of Judaism, then, but a fulfillment of it,” the signatories write. “When our sages taught that to destroy one life is to destroy an entire world, they did not carve exceptions for Palestinians. We shall not rest until this ceasefire carries forward into an end of occupation and apartheid.” Since 7 October 2023, at least 65,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 167,000 injured, according to Gaza’s health ministry, while the UN estimates that roughly 90% of the population is internally displaced. Two US Democratic senators, Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley, concluded after a fact-finding mission to the region in September that Israel was implementing “a systematic plan to destroy and ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza”, with the US complicit in these actions. Their report detailed the near-total destruction of civilian infrastructure, the weaponization of food and systematic obstacles to humanitarian aid delivery. The 10 October ceasefire has been shaken by repeated violations. The Palestinian news agency said Israel had violated the ceasefire 80 times and killed at least 80 Palestinians in the past 11 days. The Israeli military accused Hamas of violating the agreement, killing two Israeli soldiers in Rafah and delaying the return of hostages’ bodies. The public letter says that the truce makes no reference to the West Bank, where settler violence continues, and the underlying conditions of occupation remain unaddressed. More than 3,200 Palestinians have been injured in attacks in the West Bank this year, according to the latest UN humanitarian office report, and the UN documented 71 settler assaults during a single week in October. In one incident this week, a 55-year-old woman was hospitalized after being clubbed by a masked settler while picking olives, an attack captured on video. The Israeli civil rights group Yesh Din has found that just 3% of investigations into settler violence between 2005 and 2024 led to convictions. Shortly after taking office, Donald Trump lifted the limited sanctions Joe Biden had imposed on dozens of violent settlers and settler groups. The ICJ is expected to issue a new ruling this week clarifying Israel’s obligations in the occupied territories, following its July 2024 non-binding advisory opinion declaring the occupation unlawful. Yet EU foreign ministers are reportedly backing away from sanctions, despite findings by the bloc’s diplomatic service that there were “indications” Israel was breaching its human rights obligations under the EU-Israel association agreement."
world/2025/sep/26/world-must-deny-israel-tools-of-genocide-says-growing-alliance-of-activist-states,"World must deny Israel ‘tools of genocide’, says growing alliance of activist states",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/26/world-must-deny-israel-tools-of-genocide-says-growing-alliance-of-activist-states,World news,2025-09-26T17:37:47Z,"The international community has a legal and moral duty to deny Israel “the tools of genocide”, the Malaysian foreign minister, Mohamad Hasan, said at a meeting in New York of the Hague Group, the growing alliance of countries dedicated to coordinating practical economic and legal steps to isolate Israel over the war in Gaza. The group, co-chaired by South Africa and Colombia, has become a central exchange for practical steps to try to pressure Israel, including stepping up collective action at ports and airports to prevent the transfer of weapons and goods to Israel, including dual-use heavy machinery. Hasan said states also needed to identify the multinational companies found to be enabling Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian land. The group, meeting as world leaders were in New York for the UN general assembly, heard calls to support the aid flotilla trying to break the Israeli siege of Palestine and for Israel to be blocked from international cultural events. The Brazilian foreign minister, Mauro Vieira, said: “We must turn indignation into action, law into justice and justice into peace.” Brazil last week joined the South African action in the international court of justice accusing Israel of a genocide and said Israel’s claim of self-defence had no application in the context of an occupation. Chile, another group member, has withdrawn its ambassador to Israel. Vieira said: “International law requires a state not only to refrain from genocide but also to prevent it. Failure to do so may give rise to state responsibility including complicity with genocide. The time has come for states to fulfil their obligations under the genocide convention, by adopting effective measures to ensure that they do not, directly or indirectly, collaborate with its perpetrators.” Brazil has called for an international mission on the model of the UN special committee against apartheid, a body established in 1962 to coordinate action to end South Africa’s apartheid government. Riyad Mansour, the Palestine envoy to the UN, said “the Hague Group represented an inflection point in the struggle to secure accountability and to prevent Israel receiving arms and services. Much more needs to be done, and fast.” Zane Dangor from the South African foreign ministry said proving a genocide is hard due to the issue of intent, but a consensus had grown that a genocide is taking place. He said stopping a genocide is not discretionary but an obligation. A report from UN experts this month concluded Israel had committed genocide in Gaza. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in an address to the general assembly on Friday denied Israel was committing genocide, saying it had frequently dropped leaflets in Gaza and sent text messages telling the civilian population to leave areas under attack."
world/2025/oct/15/xi-directs-quashing-of-chinese-feminists-even-as-he-praises-advances-at-womens-conference,Xi directs quashing of Chinese feminists even as he praises advances at women’s conference,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/xi-directs-quashing-of-chinese-feminists-even-as-he-praises-advances-at-womens-conference,World news,2025-10-15T02:00:10Z,"Addressing dignitaries gathered in Beijing on Monday, Xi Jinping praised the “historic achievements” of women’s rights in China. In the past 30 years, the Chinese president said, maternal mortality rates had dropped by nearly 80%, and women were now participating in the project of national governance with “unprecedented confidence and vigour”. Xi was speaking at the global women’s summit, an event on Monday and Tuesday to mark the 30th anniversary of the historic UN’s world conference on women, which took place in Beijing. It was there in 1995 that Hillary Clinton, the then US first lady, delivered her “women’s rights are human rights” speech, lines now often quoted by people in China advocating for women’s rights. This year, Chinese officials used Xi’s speech to highlight the contributions that China has made to women’s advancements. Xi announced a $10m (£7.5m) donation to UN Women, the organisation’s gender-equality agency, as well as a $100m fund for global south countries. But while Xi hailed a “glorious chapter of women’s progress”, in recent years, Chinese feminists have found it increasingly difficult to advocate for, or even speak about, women’s rights. “Today, countless people, primarily young women, identify as feminists and practice feminist choices in their personal lives,” said Lü Pin, an activist based in New Jersey who founded an influential feminist organisation in China that was forced to close in 2018. “However, feminist activities beyond personal life are severely limited, including public discussion, let alone policy advocacy, accountability and collective action,” said Lü, who has been based in the US since 2015, when several of her associates, known as the “feminist five”, were detained in China after a protest they staged about sexual harassment on public transport. As leader, Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society and led a patriarchal turn in politics. In 2022 he unveiled a new politburo, the executive body of the Chinese Communist party, which for the first time since 1997 included no women. Although social attitudes towards divorce and workplace equality have become more liberal, the government routinely exhorts women to fulfil what it says are traditional responsibilities of marriage and child-bearing, especially to help the country tackle its falling birthrate. In 2023, Xi said that China should “cultivate a new marriage and child-bearing culture”. While organised feminist groups have mostly been squashed, there are still independent bloggers and commentators who focus on women’s issues. However, even these are under increasing pressure. Last month, the official WeChat account of feminist blogger Jiang Chan, whose articles regularly garnered more than 100,000 views, according to China Digital Times, was deleted. It came a few weeks after more than 1,300 accounts on Weibo, a separate social media platform with nearly 600 million monthly active users, were given temporary or permanent bans for inciting “gender antagonism”. One account was temporarily banned for posting “extreme anti-marriage” rhetoric. In June, the platform launched a dedicated complaints category for reporting content that “promotes gender antagonism”. Wang Huiling, a vlogger from rural Anhui province, shot to fame during the Covid-19 pandemic with her forthright videos about marriage, family and women’s independence. Her experience of coming from a village, where social norms are more conservative, stood in contrast to the more middle-class feminist discourse from China’s cities. “When I started posting videos online in 2019, I hadn’t heard of feminism,” she said. She just wanted to share the real-life struggles that she and the women around her faced in Chinese society. “It was only later that I realised I was part of the feminist community and that women fighting for their human rights were feminists.” At her peak, she had more than 4 million followers on Douyin, TikTok’s sister app in China, and, according to Wang, more than 6 million fans across different platforms. But Wang’s precise reach in China is now hard to gauge because, in January, all of her social media accounts were deleted without explanation. In April, she was informed that her 2021 memoir, Grassroots Women, had been banned from being reprinted (although it is still available for sale on e-commerce platforms). “I don’t know the specific reason for the ban, but it was probably because they were afraid of my awakening of independence in some women,” Wang said.

world/2025/nov/11/istanbul-mayor-ekrem-imamoglu-charged-bribery-extortion-turkey,"‘Entirely political’: Istanbul mayor charged with 142 offences that could total 2,000 years in jail",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/istanbul-mayor-ekrem-imamoglu-charged-bribery-extortion-turkey,World news,2025-11-11T15:10:03Z,"Turkish prosecutors have charged Istanbul’s jailed mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, with 142 offences that could carry a penalty of hundreds of years in prison, in a move seen as a politically motivated attack on the country’s opposition. The indictment filed on Tuesday, which runs to nearly 4,000 pages, charges the popular opposition figure who was arrested on 19 March with offences including running a criminal organisation, bribery, embezzlement, money laundering, extortion and tender rigging. The state news agency, Anadolu, said prosecutors would be asking for prison sentences that could amount to up to 2,430 years behind bars if he is found guilty. Turkey’s opposition leader said the charges were intended to prevent İmamoğlu running for president in the 2028 election. “This case is not legal, it is entirely political. Its purpose is to stop the Republican People’s party (CHP), which came first in the last local elections, and to block its presidential candidate,” Özgür Özel said on X. The arrest of İmamoğlu, the main political rival of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was met with outrage from the CHP and prompted demonstrations across Turkey. It was the country’s worst street unrest since 2013. İmamoğlu faces allegations that include espionage and faking his university degree, which could lead to him being banned from running for president. According to the indictment, which names 402 suspects, İmamoğlu allegedly headed a crime network over which he exerted his influence “like an octopus”. In an address to parliament on Tuesday, Özel said İmamoğlu would be the party’s candidate in the next presidential vote. “Can someone be both an electoral fraudster, hold a forged decree and be a thief, a terrorist and a spy all at the same time?” he said before the indictment was released. “If you accused an innocent person of just one of these crimes, it would be a great injustice. But when you put all of them on one person, it’s a major crime … But his only crime is running for the presidency of this country,” he said. Also in the indictment, prosecutors said they had filed papers with Turkey’s top appeals court against the CHP, which observers said could pave the way for the party’s closure. In a separate statement, the Istanbul prosecutor’s office confirmed it had informed the court about certain irregularities but denied reports it was seeking to have the party shut down. The CHP has been under increasing pressure since it won control of Turkey’s largest cities in local elections in March 2024. Sixteen of its mayors have since been jailed. An Ankara court dismissed a case in October challenging the legitimacy of the outcome of the party’s 2023 leadership primary, saying there was no legal basis for removing the current leadership from office. The move could have unseated Özel, who is facing a number of lawsuits including one for insulting the president."
world/2025/nov/21/zoo-industry-association-chief-david-field-interview,‘There are many zoos I would like to see closed’: world zoo chief plans shake-up,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/21/zoo-industry-association-chief-david-field-interview,World news,2025-11-21T14:08:42Z,"He has loved zoos all his life, but would close many of them down if he could. David Field, who this month became head of the world’s zoo industry group, said of zoos that treat animals badly: “It makes me feel desperate. I’ve probably in my life tried to close down more zoos than open them.” He’s taken up the mantle of keeping the world’s zoos in check at an interesting time, when their role in modern society is the subject of heated debate, with rows about lonely gorillas or penguins kept in a basement seeming to erupt every week. Keeping wild animals solely for entertainment purposes was socially acceptable some decades ago, but there are now far more concerns for their welfare and the conservation objectives of their captivity. This particularly applies to animals such as elephants, which need large spaces to roam and in the wild have complex relationships within giant social groups. As the new president of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Field hopes he will be in a position to address some of that. Speaking to the Guardian exclusively, he said: “There are many zoos in this country and certainly abroad that I would like to see closed. I think there are zoos in the UK and exotic animal collections that are not achieving the standards we would expect and also are not giving back in terms of conservation and education, and that is fundamentally wrong.” Zoo fans stress their role in conservation. But charities such as Born Free have pointed out that the vast majority of species kept in zoos do not have planned reintroduction programmes, and therefore they suspect the animals are kept only for entertainment purposes and “exploited”. A recent report found numerous welfare breaches in UK zoos, including animals kept outside in poor weather without access to shelter. The UK government is now obliging zoos to have a conservation focus, in an update to regulations. Elephants will also need to be kept in larger enclosures and birds of prey must be kept in large aviaries rather than being tethered. Another new rule is a ban on visitors touching fish, rays or cephalopods such as octopuses. Field, who has loved zoos all his life, first volunteering at Dudley zoo aged 12, then working as a curator of animal collections in Edinburgh, Dublin and London before becoming chief executive of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, welcomes these regulations. But, he admits, the bad zoos, which are often not regulated as part of the network Field now chairs, are overbreeding animals. “There are a lot of bad zoos out there which are breeding animals for commercial and wrong purposes. As a matter of last resort, there are times when an animal might need to be euthanised. With lots of forward planning, this can be minimised as much as possible.” Which animals should be in zoos? Elephants? Polar bears? Field agrees it’s a topic of discussion: “Currently there are some new polar bear exhibits in the UK and we are going through a very strong welfare audit. We have some concerns about those down south and we are concerned about the heat.” Elephants also need more space and company than captivity can provide, and Field says that the zoo must be suitable; Whipsnade is “exceptional”, but a zoo such as Edinburgh doesn’t have the space. 75 members of parliament recently signed a motion asking for the 15 penguins currently housed in the basement of the London Aquarium, where they don’t get any daylight, to be freed. “I think their veterinary and physiological needs are catered for.” Field said. “But if people are seeing an animal in an environment they don’t feel comfortable with, they lose their connection.” One creature which should never be kept in UK zoos, he said, is the orca. “We don’t have anywhere in the UK that could keep orcas,” he said. “The way we keep cetaceans, we need to review and progress. The UK won’t ever be a place for them.” Pandas, however, are a different matter. Field was at the centre of media headlines after the Chinese government took back two pandas, Yang Guan and Tian Tian, who were on loan to Edinburgh zoo. There is controversy around China’s use of pandas in diplomacy and the way the government uses them to exert pressure abroad. Field said: “I would have loved for them to have stayed for the rest of their lives. Sadly the contractual requirements around pandas and China and the diplomacy associated meant there was no loophole of any shape or form to have kept them. The way pandas are part of the bigger zoo network does need to be reviewed. I hope as far as my global role [goes], I can engage with the Chinese zoos.” Zoos can play a useful role in rewilding, says Field. His zoo recently pioneered the release of wildcats back to Scotland, breeding and releasing them in the Cairngorms national park. This pioneering release of carnivores, he believes, could pave the way for zoos to reintroduce big cats into the wild globally. “Carnivores are a difficult one. The science we are doing is feeding into this work for different species. Lynx is definitely being spoken about in the UK, we have previously spoken about leopards, which are on hold at the moment, but there is the amazing Iberian lynx, the Florida panther – this work is going on.” The zoo made headlines again after suspected rogue rewilders dumped lynx in the Scottish highlands. Field had to clean up afterwards, and says the lynx dumping was “evil”. “[The lynx] were so desperate for human care that they opened the traps and they walked in. This is a serious, serious science. It can’t just be done by anyone.” He’d love to see lynx roaming wild again but doesn’t believe wolves have a place in the UK as wild animals, however, and fears the same person might dump wolves. Field is quite clear that zoos can make a huge contribution to society, and warns that sometimes, as in the recent stories about the “lonely gorillas” at Bristol zoo, readers must look beyond the headlines. “We do put our emotions into animals. If I went to smile at my chimpanzees right now they would have huge fear because if you bare their teeth you are expressing fear and anger. Perhaps it gave people a lot of emotion and care for the animals but we need to look behind the shocking headline. In the case of those gorillas I can vouch that they are looked after.”"
world/2025/oct/17/broken-promises-and-political-crises-how-emmanuel-macron-fell-from-french-favour,Broken promises and political crises: how Emmanuel Macron fell from French favour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/broken-promises-and-political-crises-how-emmanuel-macron-fell-from-french-favour,World news,2025-10-17T14:43:39Z,"Three French governments have collapsed in less than a year, and the political crisis looks likely to continue, overshadowing Emmanuel Macron’s last 18 months in power and his domestic legacy. This week, the latest minority government narrowly survived its first vote of no confidence. But it remains the weakest cabinet in decades and could be toppled at any moment if opposition parties join together to oust it. France faces a brutal two-month battle in parliament to achieve what once seemed the most basic element of governance: passing a budget. Political analysts argue that that the figure most damaged by the current crisis is the centrist president. The pro-Europe, pro-business Macron was first elected in 2017, vowing to revolutionise politics and listen to voters like no one had done before. He promised a “pragmatic” cherrypicking of ideas from left and right to liberalise the economy, create jobs after decades of mass unemployment and end inequality. Crucially, he said he wanted to stop the rise of the far right by ensuring citizens had no more reason to vote for extremes. There were crises: the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government revolt, followed by the Covid pandemic and then the war in Ukraine. And when he was re-elected in 2022, Macron no longer had an absolute majority in parliament. But his woes deepened considerably when he gambled on calling a sudden and inconclusive snap parliamentary election in June 2024, at a time when Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (NR) was at a historic high after its European election win. Parliament is now split between three blocs: the left, the centre and the far right, which has increased its vote. No bloc has an absolute majority. Meanwhile, Macron’s centrist base has begun to fragment. “The crisis in France runs very deep,” said Rémi Lefebvre, a professor of political science at the University of Lille. “The problem is there are actually several crises mixed together. There’s a financial crisis of [public] debt, a social crisis of inequality, a weakness of political parties, and then there is the rise of the far right. Macron is not the sole cause of the crisis; it’s all those different factors, but Macron has accelerated those factors.” To prevent the government being ousted this week, Macron and his centrist ally, the new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, appealed to the Socialist party. The government offered a highly symbolic suspension of the only major change of Macron’s second term: the 2023 pensions law that introduced a gradual rise in the retirement age from 62 to 64. Lefebvre said Macron’s second term risked looking “chaotic” and ineffective. His choice not to appoint a leftwing government last year – when a left alliance won the greatest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority – had been seen as damaging democracy, he said. Stewart Chau, the director of polling at Verian Group, said: “If there’s one political personality or political movement that emerges extremely weakened from the sequence which began with the snap election of July 2024, it’s Emmanuel Macron and his centrist party, Renaissance. That is clear in every study.” Polls this month have shown that only about 14-16% of voters have confidence in Macron. Even his global presence, which once boosted his image at home, no longer lifts his ratings. “His popularity has constantly declined in recent months, despite a significant international news cycle,” Chau said. Support had dropped among Macron’s voters because he was seen as lacking empathy for people’s daily concerns, Chau said. “One of Macron’s biggest promises as president had been his vow to block the path of the far-right National Rally, saying that no one would ever have reason to vote for them again,” he added. But since Macron became president, more people have voted for the RN and view the party as a credible alternative. “That is a real shift,” Chau said. “Previously, some people had voted for extremes, saying it was a protest vote. Today, a lot of French people think it’s no longer simply a protest vote, it’s an alternative – and Macron is, perhaps, responsible for that.” The political historian, Jean Garrigues, said Macron’s image was now probably the worst of any president since France’s current political system, the Fifth Republic, began in 1958. “He has dropped to an exceptional level of unpopularity but, above all, an exceptional level of hatred,” Garrigues said. “[His Socialist predecessor] François Hollande also experienced record unpopularity but didn’t experience the same level of being detested as Emmanuel Macron.” Garrigues said this public rejection had roots that ran deeper than the current crisis. Macron arrived in 2017 amid strong hope and expectation built around a kind of mythology of the “man of the moment”, he said, but disappointment followed when voters felt his promises to work with all political sides and “permanently listen to citizens” were not materialising."
world/2025/nov/19/watch-out-online-contact-chinese-spies-uk-defence-minister-warns-public,"Watch out for online contact with Chinese spies, UK defence minister warns public",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/watch-out-online-contact-chinese-spies-uk-defence-minister-warns-public,World news,2025-11-19T09:44:17Z,"Ordinary UK citizens need to watch out for online contact with Chinese spies, the defence minister has said, after MI5 issued an espionage alert to parliament. Luke Pollard said a warning given to parliamentarians on Tuesday that China was attempting to recruit individuals with access to sensitive information should also be heeded by the public at large. Security services took the unusual step of advising MPs, Lords and their staff to be alert to contact from spies, revealing two LinkedIn accounts that had been used to try to recruit those with access to non-public information. “That’s advice that should be heeded by the rest of the public as well,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sky News. “Because as we become more online as a community, the ability for people that wish us harm or wish us to gain access to information they shouldn’t have access to becomes more plentiful.” The security services identified two accounts on LinkedIn going by the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen, both purporting to be headhunters, which were thought to be linked to espionage. The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said in parliament on Tuesday it was “a covert and calculated” attempt by the Chinese government to recruit people close to power. In response, Beijing accused the UK spy agency of “groundlessly hyping up” the issue, and said it was not interested in “so-called intelligence” from the UK parliament. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, told a press briefing on Wednesday: “China never interferes in other countries’ internal affairs and has no interest in collecting so-called intelligence from the UK parliament.” One parliamentary worker who had been contacted by Shirly Shen told the BBC he had ignored the message but was concerned that less experienced staff might have responded to it. He said: “The message wasn’t written in very good English, it was a message to say there was a job opportunity and was I interested, and to get in touch if I was. “I’ve worked around parliament for about 10 years now so I’m kind of used to this. But if you were more junior, you don’t know what you’re looking for. You might think it’s a genuine offer that’s made to you on LinkedIn, they might accept.” He said he believed this kind of contact was becoming more common. “They have realised the way to get to parliamentarians is through their staff … it’s deeply worrying,” he said. It comes not long after the collapse of a trial into alleged spying by two British people for China. Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, his China-based friend, were accused of espionage but the charges were dropped a month before the court case was due to begin. The Crown Prosecution Service said it had been forced to abandon the case after the government failed to provide reassurance that China was “a current threat to national security”, a threshold that needed to be met to go ahead with the prosecution. The wording of the 1911 law around espionage refers to gathering information “directly or indirectly useful to an enemy”, a definition that could have strained the UK’s already fragile relationship with the superpower. Pollard, who was doing the rounds on breakfast television and radio, said: “China poses a number of threats to the UK, but they also present a number of opportunities for the UK. It’s a complex picture with China, as I’m sure you’ve heard from government ministers over many weeks on this.” Appearing on the LBC radio breakfast show with Nick Ferrari, Pollard was challenged on the government’s purchase of Chinese technology, including vehicles used by the military that could contain listening devices. Pollard told Ferrari the government was “looking carefully at what the options are with Chinese technology”."

The European Commission has proposed suspending some of the trade parts of the EU Israel association agreement, 18 months after Ireland and Spain asked commission president Ursula von der Leyen to review the agreement in light of the war in Gaza (13:36). Senior EU officials said the proposals were “appropriate and proportionate” as a response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza (13:37, 13:53), and will still need to be approved by the EU member states (14:07). But Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar warned the EU against taking action, calling the proposal to suspend the trade element of the EU-Israel association agreement “morally and politically distorted” (15:35). In other news, Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, said that two foreign laboratories had confirmed her husband was poisoned, after tests on biological samples secretly smuggled out of Russia (10:54). Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday he was unaware of Navalnaya’s claims. Elsewhere, Denmark is for the first time to buy long-range precision weapons such as missiles and drones, Mette Frederiksen has abruptly announced, as she warned “Russia is testing us” (12:39, 12:58, 13:00). Frederiksen warned that Russia is “constantly trying to push the boundaries” and “wants conflict with Nato” (13:04). The total package, worth €7.7bn, is “the largest single investment in Danish defence ever,” the country’s ministry said (13:16). Russia’s ambassador to Denmark branded the plans as “pure madness” and said he considered the comments to be “publicly threatening a nuclear power” (17:41). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa. Russia’s ambassador to Denmark has reacted to Copenhagen’s announcement that it is getting long-range weapons (12:39, 12:58), telling Berlingske that it is “pure madness”. Vladimir Barbin said: “No one, anywhere, ever in the world has considered publicly threatening a nuclear power. These statements will undoubtedly be taken into account.” Lithuanian authorities said they have identified 15 individuals behind four attempted terrorist acts in Germany, Poland and the UK involving exploding parcels and confirmed their links to Russian military intelligence. The Lithuanian general prosecutor and the country’s criminal police said in a joint statement that they investigated four detonations or attempted detonations of parcels carried by DHL and DPD courier services last year. Parcels were reported exploding at Leipzig airport in Germany, in a DPD freight truck in Poland, and in a DHL warehouse near Birmingham, the UK, while the fourth shipment failed to ignite. The investigation – conducted together with officials from nine countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and the US – led them to a 42-year-old Lithuanian citizen, who they allege worked with accomplices, and sent the parcels from Vilnius, Lithuania. Crucially, the report said the coordination of the attacks was led by two Russian citizens “associated and having connections with the military intelligence services of the Russian Federation.” Other citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine were also reportedly involved, including through the Telegram messenger, with a total of 15 suspects. International arrest warrants have been issued against three of them. in Brussels The EU executive has called for a suspension of free trade with Israel and sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers in response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Ursula von der Leyen had already floated the proposal to suspend the trade parts of the EU-Israel association agreement last week as the European Commission faced intense pressure for greater action amid criticism that it was not using its economic leverage to influence the Israeli government. There is, however, no certain majority from EU member states for the proposals outlined on Wednesday, because Germany, one of Israel’s key allies, has long been reluctant to take such steps. The proposals include suspending Israel’s preferential access to the European market by reimposing tariffs on some goods, and freezing mutual benefits related to bidding for public contracts and the protection of intellectual property rights. The commission also called for sanctions on Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank and 10 Hamas leaders. The plans were presented as Israeli forces pressed ahead with their offensive in Gaza City, deepening a conflict that has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. The Paris chief of police Laurent Nuñez said he was “very concerned” about the prospect of public disturbance on the margins of the trade union protests scheduled for Thursday, Le Figaro reported. Nuñez claimed he had reports about plans to disrupt the protest with the intention to “fight and cause damage,” warning shopkeepers to protect their shop fronts, the paper said. The strikes are intented to push back on what unions see as unfair austerity policies, AP said, as they reject cuts in social spending and pension reform. They are expected to prompt disruption in sectors like transport, public services, hospitals and schools. More than 250 demonstrations are planned across the country, Le Monde said. Meanwhile, Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar warned the EU against taking action against Israel, after the bloc’s executive proposed curbing trade ties and sanctioning ministers over the Gaza war, AFP reported. “The recommendations of the college of Commissioners led by President (Ursula) von der Leyen are morally and politically distorted,” Saar wrote on X, adding that: “Moves against Israel will harm Europe’s own interests.” “Any action against Israel will receive an appropriate response, and we hope we will not have to use them,” he wrote. Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, said that two foreign laboratories had confirmed her husband was poisoned, after tests on biological samples secretly smuggled out of Russia (as reported 10:54). Navalny, 47, died suddenly on 16 February 2024, while being held in a jail about 40 miles (64km) north of the Arctic Circle, where he had been sentenced to decades in prison to be served in a “special regime”. Navalny’s allies have accused the Kremlin repeatedly of killing him – allegations Moscow has dismissed as absurd. Russian officials insist he died of a mixture of diseases, including heart arrhythmia triggered by hypertension. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday he was unaware of Navalnaya’s claims. Navalnaya, who lives abroad, posted a video on X in which she said biological material from Navalny was smuggled abroad in 2024 and then examined by two laboratories. “These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,” Navalnaya said, urging the two laboratories to release the findings. “These results are of public importance and must be published. We all deserve to know the truth,” she said. She did not specify what poison the laboratories had found. Navalnaya also said the surveillance footage from the final day of her husband’s life had vanished, despite the opposition leader being under near-constant camera monitoring throughout his imprisonment. Navalny’s allies also released previously unseen photographs they said were taken inside the prison cell after his death. The images show a cramped cell with what appears to be vomit and blood on the floor, next to a notebook and an Oxford dictionary. Leonid Volkov, a close ally of Navalny, wrote on X that the opposition leader had been “murdered in an agonising way, with poison”. He added: “No matter how much they tried to erase details from the medical records or cover their tracks, we know everything about his final day and the method of his killing.” The regional penitentiary service said in a statement at the time of his death that Navalny “felt unwell after a walk and almost immediately lost consciousness”. Towards the end of the press conference, Kallas rejected suggestions that the EU has not done enough to put pressure on Israel and insisted the public opinion has shifted on this in recent months, as reflected by the proposed measures. “The proposals [are] now on the table to put more pressure on Israeli government … now it’s up to the member states to discuss [them] in the council, which is problematic, as we know of the lines. But what it shows, really, it shows that the public opinion in all the member states has, has really shifted. And when we have the discussions, all the member states or representatives, foreign ministers, agree that the situation is untenable. So if we all agree on this, then the question is, what do we do about this; what are the tools in our hands? And that’s why we have proposed, then from our commission, to go with these proposals. If these do not fly, then we can find other things, if we all agree that we need to do additional steps in order to have really change on the ground.” This concludes the press conference. Today’s proposal by the European Commission to suspend trade parts of the EU Israeli association would not mean Israeli goods disappearing from European supermarkets, factories, or hospitals. If adopted by the member states, who need to agree to it under qualified majority vote system (QMV), it would merely mean goods would no longer be duty free and subject to tariffs that apply to all non-EU countries that do not have a trade agreement with the bloc. The EU is responsible for 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods with the world, selling some €16bn in 2024. Israeli exports include everything from jet engines to pharmaceuticals including those from Teva. However, not all goods are exported under tariffs, as they are for example not imposed on pharmaceuticals under a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement. Under the QMV system two conditions have to be met. 55% of member states need to back to the move. This means 15 out of 27 member states, but the bigger barrier is that the proposal must be supported by member states representing 65% of the total EU population. Germany represents 18% of the EU population, France 15% and Italy 11%. Maroš Šefčovič, the trade commissioner, admitted that the impact of the removal of free trade access, would be “modest”, as he told reporters that their suggestions that tariffs would amount to an additional cost of just €227m a year were “correct”. Whatever its economic consequences, it can be seen as a hugely symbolic move. “I would say the whole context of the decision was very political. … I think there was strong expectations that European Union have to use the tools at its disposal to address the humanitarian crisis,” he said. EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, was also asked about whether she was confident about getting the suspension approved by the member states. She said: “You know very well, how is the situation the council, although we see that … the public opinion in member states is really shifting because the suffering in Gaza and people really want to see [this stopped]. I think we will have the discussions after these proposals are made, but I think the political lines are very much in the place where they have been so far.” EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič is now speaking about the practical consequences of the proposed measures. “In practice, this means that imports from Israel to the EU will lose the preferential access to the EU market, and that these goods will be charged duties at the level applied to any other third countries with whom the EU has no free trade agreement. We regret having to take this step. However, we believe it is both appropriate and proportionate given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.” Šefčovič said the total trade in goods amounted to €42.6bn in 2024, making the EU Israel’s number one trading partner. “In light of these figures and the principles at stake, the proposed partial suspension is a carefully considered response to an increasingly urgent situation,” he says. He says the EU “believes that now is the time that we must work together to end also the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.” “This means unrestrained access for humanitarian aid, the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas and an urgent ceasefire to stop the bloodshed.” Ultimately, Israel needs real security and the Palestinian people need real dignity. He says the member states will decide on this measure by a qualified majority. The European Commission has proposed suspending some of the trade parts of the EU Israel association agreement, 18 months after Ireland and Spain asked commission president Ursula von der Leyen to review the agreement in light of the war in Gaza. Following her state of the union speech last week indicating a shift at the top of the EU, the Commission’s presented a proposal today. In addition it has announced it had put bilateral support for Israel on hold with the exception of contributions to support civil society and the Yad Vashem holocaust museum. It also proposed sanctions on Hamas, extremist ministers and violent settlers. In a statement, the EU said the proposal on the trade agreement follows a review of Article 2 of the association agreement following “the blockade of humanitarian aid, the intensifying of military operations and the decision of the Israeli authorities to advance the settlement plan in the so-called E1 area of the West Bank”. The proposed suspension must be ratified by member states who are already blocking a European Commission proposal to suspend Israel from part of the Horizon European science research programme. Follow our Middle East blog for more updates: Polish energy minister Miłosz Motyka has called on the EU to end Russian oil imports by the end of 2026 “to cease financing Russia’s war machine” and help end the war in Ukraine. In a letter sent to other EU energy ministers just days after Russian drones incursion into Polish airspace, seen by the Guardian, Motyka argued that “the current international circumstances, combined with the need to strengthen the resilience of European economies, require a common response.” He said that a commitment to the 2026 deadline would “establish a clear timeline, and demonstrate our resolve to achieve independence from oil supplies burdened with political and strategic risks.” Poland also called for “coordinated … compensatory mechanisms” to help with “a fair and orderly transition” for countries most affected, which would also include measures on “safeguarding access to alternative oil sources in the event of disruptions.” Reuters noted that the Druzhba oil pipeline delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, which continue to buy energy supplies from Russia after other EU nations cut ties following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The letter comes a day after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she would propose speeding phasing out of Russian fossil imports after her call with US president Donald Trump last night. The bloc had previously intended to end purchases of Russian oil and gas by 2028. Trump repeatedly called on the EU and Nato countries to stop buying oil from Russia, seemingly making it a condition of future US sanctions on Moscow. The total package for acquisition and operation of ground-based air and missile defence systems is estimated to be worth 58 billion kroner, equivalent to €7.7bn or £6.74bn, “the largest single investment ever in Danish defence.” The defence ministry’s press release outlined some details of the proposed purchases, saying that that Denmark will look to procure the French-Italian SAMP/T NG air defence system for the long-range missiles, and “one or more” from the Norwegian NASAMS, the German IRIS-T or the French VL MICA systems. It said that “the decision to go with more than one or two suppliers enable shorter delivery times” and reaching readiness “as quickly as possible.” The first system is expected to be operational this year. Nordic correspondent Frederiksen insisted that the move is not an escalation but that it is a “political choice”. “We are making a political choice about what it means to be able to defend ourselves,” she said. “To put it bluntly, it’s not enough to have an air defence to keep out what’s out there. You have to show your will to be able to do more.” Russia, she said, is “constantly trying to push the boundaries” and “wants conflict with Nato.” Referencing Russia’s recent violation of Polish airspace, she said: “They will continue to see what reaction comes. That’s why it’s also the right time to make this decision.” She said: Russia wants conflict with Nato. But the Danes should not go around fearing a military attack right now. Nordic correspondent The Danish ministry of defence said in a press release: “Based on the military-technical recommendation of the Chief of Defence, the government has made a decision in principle that Denmark must have long-range precision weapons.” It added that the move is being carried out “with a view to strengthening Denmark’s national and Nato and allies’ collective deterrence.” Denmark’s chief of defence, Michael Hyldgaard, said: “It is necessary for the Armed Forces to be able to counter threats before they reach our territory. It is about giving the Armed Forces the right tools to solve the task. We are getting that now.” Nordic correspondent Denmark is for the first time to buy long-range precision weapons such as missiles and drones, Mette Frederiksen has abruptly announced, as she warned “Russia is testing us”. In what she described as a “paradigm shift”, the Danish prime minister said that Denmark’s air defence is not strong enough and needs to be able to hit targets at long distances and “combat enemy missile threats”. “Russia is testing us. They are testing our unity,” she said in a last minute press conference that was only announced this morning. There is no doubt that Russia will be a threat to Denmark and Europe for many years to come. The move comes at the recommendation of the chief of defence, Troels Lund Poulsen, Denmark’s defence minister, said. Although Frederiksen said the global situation is serious, she added that “there is currently no concrete threat to Denmark”. It is however a reflection of the perceived severity of the security situation in Europe with Russia to the east and Donald Trump making threats to Denmark from across the Atlantic. Danish newspaper Berlingske is calling the announcement “historic”. We are just getting a line from Copenhagen that Denmark plans to acquire long-range precision weapons to boost its security, the country’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen said. We will bring you more on this soon. Official Britain is laying out the red carpet for Donald Trump today. It is the first full day of his unprecedented state visit, and he will spend it with King Charles at Windsor Castle enjoying the finest pageantry the nation can lay on. Keir Starmer, like other Western leaders, has concluded that the key to getting positive outcomes from Trump is flattery and shameless sucking up, and (not for the first time) the royal family is being deployed to this end. But civic Britain will also have its say on Trump today, and – perhaps mindful of his obsession with big crowds and his (supposed) love for free speech – there will be protests all over the country. When Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president in the Trump’s first administration, was asked he felt about being booed one night when he attended the theatre, he said that was “the sound of freedom”. Trump’s response to protesters is much darker. But there is almost no chance of his hearing “the sound of freedom” today; his state visit is taking place entirely behind closed doors. Follow live updates: Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has just claimed that two laboratory tests, conducted independently of each other, show her husband was poisoned before death. In a YouTube video, she recalled in detail the last letter from her husband, a day before his death in a penal colony in Russia, and his last days in custody, detailing the authorities’ lack of reaction to his first reports of being unwell. She also showed photographs from inside the cell where he fell ill. On the video, she explained that “back in February 2024, we were able to obtain and securely transfer biological samples of Alexei abroad,” and “laboratories in at least two countries independently tested those samples.” “Labs in two different coountries independently concluded: Alexei was killed; namely, poisoned,” she said, without offering further supporting evidence. “I demand that the laboratories that conducted the analyses publish their results,” she said. “I assert that Vladimir Putin is responsible for the murder of my husband, Alexei Navalny,” she said in the video. “Stop appeasing Putin for some higher ‘considerations’. You cannot placate him. While you stay silent, he doesn’t stop,” she said. In other news from Germany, the main suspect in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann was released from a German prison after serving out a seven-year sentence for an unrelated sex crime, Reuters reported. German prosecutors first named Christian Brückner a suspect in 2020, when he was already serving the sentence for raping a 72-year-old woman in the same part of Portugal’s Algarve region where McCann went missing. “I can confirm that he was released at 9:15 local time, accompanied by a police escort,” said Marcell Farbowski, spokesperson of the prison in Sehnde, adding that Brückner had been driven away by his lawyer. Reuters noted that Brückner’s lawyer denies any connection with the McCann case. He did not immediately respond to a request to comment on his client’s release. Brückner, 49, has convictions for child abuse and drug trafficking in addition to the rape of the woman, who has since died. Der Spiegel said Brückner’s release was tied to very strict conditions: his passport has been cancelled, he will wear an electronic tag and must declare a place of residence that he cannot leave without permission. Reuters said that police in Britain, Germany and Portugal, who have identified Brueckner as their main suspect, have long sought evidence to link him conclusively to the case. Portuguese and German police spent four days digging for evidence in the Algarve in June. Speaking before Merz, AfD’s leader Alice Weidel attacked him by saying that “the citizens are growing impatient,” and accusing him of “complacency” and “denial of reality.” She paid tribute to US conservative activist and influencer Charlie Kirk killed in the US. She also heavily focused on migration, talking about “the fatal ‘we can do it’ line of his party colleague Angela Merkel” in 2015, and its consequences for today’s Germany, as she called for “a real turnaround” in approach. “Close the borders completely and without exception. Reject illegal immigrants without valid papers and those not entitled to asylum, without exception. Naturalisation after ten years, at the earliest,” she listed her policies. She then accused Merz of “breaking every election promise” on energy, taxation, and public finances. In a particularly bruising line, she said that faced with “plummeting approval ratings,” Merz was pretending to be a global leader alongside France’s Macron and Britain’s Starmer “whom his own people no longer want in office” in the “coalition of losers, with their backs to the wall and playing with fire.” She claimed they were “sabotaging” Trump’s plans to end the war in Ukraine but urging Zelenskyy to resist making concessions, “conjuring up the bogeyman of an imminent Russian attack” to justify their spending plans. Remember: as mentioned in the opening post, this is the leader of the party that is top of the polls, looking at the YouGov poll this morning (8:46). Merz also talks about the need to “establish a new consensus” on welfare policies, saying “some reforms are inevitable” if Germany is “to be able to fulfil the social promises we want to make in the future.” He hints this would cover changes to the pension system and other elements, including unemployment benefits. He then makes his regular points about the need for a new “realistic” energy policy, and the government’s “economic reform agenda” to increase productivity, reduce bureaucracy, and push to modernise the state. Coming to conclusions, he once again stresses the urgency to move and resolve “longstanding problems” the country is facing. Merz repeats his regular line on defence as he says: We want to be able to defend ourselves so that we do not have to defend ourselves. But he also makes a broader point about the importance of modernising the country, its civil protection plans, and the army. He also talks about trade, including looking for new partners “in an increasingly complex world.” He says that “the separation between domestic and foreign policy is simply outdated,” as the government’s actions abroad “serve to preserve freedom, peace and prosperity at home.” He also mentions progress on his government’s mission to lower the number of asylum applications in response to growing migratory pressures. US president Donald Trump is now in Britain and set to begin the first full day of his second state visit. While most of today’s events are ceremonial, there’s a very long list of things that the UK government will be hoping to discuss and achieve during his stay in England, including talks on trade, defence and security, Ukraine, and the Middle East, to name just a few. But the visit is already off to a rocky start after four people have been arrested after images of him alongside deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle, where Trump is set to be hosted by King Charles, with separate group of protesters also gathering in the area. Meanwhile in Germany, the Bundestag is back from the summer break this week and set to hold a general debate on current affairs. After a rocky start for his government, chancellor Friedrich Merz will be hoping for a better start to the political autumn. But the pressure is very much on as the far-right Alternative für Deutschland has for the first time come top in the latest YouGov poll this morning at 27%, ahead of the governing CDU at 26%, and the junior coalition partner SPD at 15%. I will follow the debate for key lines. Lots of things for us to cover today. It’s Wednesday, 17 September 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning. Opening the debate in the Bundestag, chancellor Friedrich Merz sets out the stakes this autumn as he says Germany faces decisions “not about details, but about very fundamental issues” that will define its future. “We must a sober look at the reality in order to choose the right path for our country,” he says. He stresses that “our freedom is under threat” with growing “sense of insecurity,” with Germany’s economic model also “under pressure” from “a new form of protectionism.” He also warns against “political forces at home and abroad” questioning social cohesion and undermining German democracy. On security, he begins by saying that the Russian invasion of Ukraine “has a very concrete impact on our lives,” and stresses: “We want this war to end.” But he concedes that “there is a reason to fear it will continue for some time.” Merz stresses that “ending it at the expense of Ukraine’s political sovereignty and territorial integrity is out of the question,” and warns that “a dictated peace” could “only encourage Putin to seek his next target.” He then condemns recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania. “Putin has long been testing the limits,” he says, but stresses: We will not allow this."
world/2025/sep/29/jack-spence-obituary,Jack Spence obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/jack-spence-obituary,World news,2025-09-29T17:07:24Z,"Jack Spence, who has died aged 94, was an influential scholar of diplomacy and South African politics. His research and policy advice contributed to South Africa’s transition from apartheid to democracy, and his mentoring of former students helped many to reach leadership positions in their fields. Although he “retired” in 1991, it was only 29 years later, after two further impactful jobs, that he really stopped work. His scholarship – rigorous, eclectic and pragmatic – positioned him as a non-partisan voice through South Africa’s key political eras: under apartheid; during the 1990 transition; and under majority rule post-1994. He was uniquely placed to engage and advise, and became a mediator with policy-makers from the liberation parties, the apartheid regime and key external actors such as the US, UK and the Soviet Union. While critical of apartheid, he urged a pragmatic understanding of South Africa’s complex political realities. In the 1980s, his nuanced views contrasted with more radical voices in the anti-apartheid movement, sometimes drawing criticism. Yet he championed academic freedom and returned frequently to lecture at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), encouraging others to do the same. His relationship with the university continued till his death; he funded a scholarship for young South Africans to study at the African Leadership Centre at King’s College London. The most significant work among his many books and more than 60 articles, Ending Apartheid (2010), co-authored with David Welsh, remains a key text on South Africa’s democratic shift. Also notable are Republic Under Pressure: A Study of South African Foreign Policy (1986), Violence in Southern Africa (1989), Lesotho: The Politics of Dependence (1977) and New Perspectives on Diplomacy (2021, edited with Claire Yorke and Alastair Masser). He co-founded two academic publications – the British Journal of International Studies and The Journal of Southern African Studies – and edited International Affairs, shaping the development of international studies in the UK and beyond. He also served as chairman of the British International Studies Association and president of the African Studies Association, and was awarded three honorary doctorates and four honorary fellowships. In 2002 he was made OBE. Born in Krugersdorp, in what is now Gauteng, South Africa, Jack was the son of Violet (nee Brown) and John Spence, a British miner who had moved to work in the country’s gold mines. He attended Pretoria boys high school and later Wits University, graduating in 1952. At the London School of Economics he studied for a degree in economics and met his wife, Sue Steen, who was taking the same subject. They moved to South Africa when Jack got a job at the University of Natal in 1958. The couple became active in the Liberal party of South Africa – the only non-racial political party open to all in the country at the time. Liberalism remained a central influence throughout Jack’s life. He returned to the LSE in 1961 as a Rockefeller junior fellow, then took up a lectureship at University College Swansea in 1962. In 1973, he was appointed to a chair in politics at the University of Leicester, where he remained until his retirement in 1991. He served as head of the department of politics and as pro-vice-chancellor (1981–85), and was known for his calm leadership and commitment to collegiality and intellectual freedom. Although he had officially retired, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) enticed him to become its director of studies in 1991. There, he developed closer ties with the South African Institute of International Affairs and in 1995, when Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Chatham House before a state visit to post-apartheid South Africa, he briefed them privately on tricky issues they might confront; he also co-hosted a Chatham House-CBI event for Nelson Mandela’s state visit to the UK the following year. True to form, in 1997, straight after retirement from Chatham House, Jack was immediately enticed back to work by the department of war studies at King’s College London, and what was initially a short-term appointment continued for 23 years. His diplomacy course became one of the most popular in the department, sometimes taught multiple times a year to meet demand. He remained active in teaching and publishing into his 80s. In addition to writing newspaper articles in the UK and South Africa, in 1994 he acted as the in-country pundit for BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, for South Africa’s first multiparty election in which all races could vote. He also gave evidence in 1993 to the Goldstone commission, which was set up to investigate political violence and intimidation during the negotiations to end apartheid. A decade later, Jack served as the specialist adviser to the House of Commons foreign affairs committee inquiry on the future of UK-South Africa relations. Beyond academia, Jack continued to advise governments, thinktanks and NGOs on African political issues. Known for distilling complex dynamics into clear, actionable insights, his expertise was highly sought after. He served as the academic adviser to the commandant at the Royal College of Defence Studies. Jack was known for his communication style – he preferred face-to-face conversations in his office or in pubs rather than emails or calls on mobiles. He would send handwritten postcards, often with encouraging notes, to colleagues and students. More than 20 years ago he advised me on how to create Chatham House’s Africa programme, which continues to thrive today. Mentorship was central to his life, and many of his students, now leaders in their fields, recall his generosity and guidance. “My spies are everywhere,” he would say with a smile, referring to his extensive network of former students. Sue died in 2021. Jack is survived by his daughter, Rachel. • Jack (John) Spence, academic and writer, born 11 June 1931; died 15 August 2025"
world/2025/aug/13/merz-manoeuvres-on-world-stage-fail-to-quell-doubts-about-leadership-germany,Merz’s manoeuvres on world stage fail to quell doubts about his leadership,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/13/merz-manoeuvres-on-world-stage-fail-to-quell-doubts-about-leadership-germany,World news,2025-08-13T16:32:35Z,"Friedrich Merz hosted the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Wednesday as a weakened leader 100 days into his term, with his attempts to rally western support for Kyiv and wrangle Donald Trump failing to silence his domestic critics. The German chancellor took the initiative for Wednesday’s lightning round of telephone conferences bringing in EU leaders, Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance. Zelenskyy’s surprise arrival in Berlin to sit in on the calls underlined Merz’s starring role in the diplomatic efforts. He has often cut a sure-footed figure on the world stage since taking office in May, including largely holding his own in an Oval Office face-off with Trump in June, but Germans remain unconvinced by their leader’s performance overall. A poll this week showed the far-right Alternative für Deutschland overtaking Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc by two points, making it the strongest party with 26% support in a fractured electoral landscape. The CDU/CSU, which won February’s general election with nearly 29% of the vote, now claims only 24% of voter intentions. The last time the AfD came out on top in the Forsa poll was in April, in a period of political limbo between the election and Merz’s new government taking office. “Mr Merz has already become unbearable after just 100 days – it’s time for an AfD government!” the party’s co-leader Alice Weidel crowed on X. The junior coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), received just 13% support, down three points from February, meaning that if an election were held this weekend, the current governing alliance, which is already showing significant cracks, would fail to win a majority. Merz, a divisive figure in German politics for decades with a long-nursed grudge against his fellow Christian Democrat Angela Merkel, has struggled to reverse a deep pessimistic streak that has taken hold in Europe’s top economy. GDP growth has failed to show a significant turnaround and is expected to flatline again this year. The government’s decision in June not to deliver a reduction in electricity tax for households and small businesses also angered many voters, and a divisive debate about the pension age has taken a political toll. On migration, which Merz has attempted to wrest as an issue from the AfD, his government has shown mixed results with a series of court setbacks and a simmering dispute with Poland over migration complicating his efforts to appear decisive. Even before taking office, he had spearheaded a major spending package for domestic defence, infrastructure and aid to Ukraine. But fiscal hawks in his own camp, who trusted him to safeguard German budgetary rectitude, were appalled by a measure they saw as a violation of his previous campaign promises. Merz, who had no experience in government before becoming chancellor, has won the respect of many western allies for his staunch support for Ukraine as Trump’s backing has wavered. The formulation of his stance on the war in Gaza, however, has proved politically dicey, alienating many of his closest allies and the Israeli government as he draws praise from the SPD. After weeks of growing criticism of Benjamin Netanyahu’s military campaign in the strip as the civilian death toll rose, Merz last week made the shock announcement that Germany would no longer approve shipments of weapons that could be used in Gaza until further notice. Prominent members of the CDU/CSU bloc accused him of failing to inform them in advance of a brash decision they said betrayed Germany’s responsibility for Israel’s security since the Holocaust. Voters, many of whom are critical of Israel’s escalatiing military action in Gaza, welcomed the move. Merz’s effort to convince Trump not to sign off on a deal with Russia at Friday’s summit with Vladimir Putin “over the heads of the Europeans and Ukrainians” looked to be another high-wire act of statesmanship, having failed to secure a seat at the table in Alaska for Zelenskyy. Matthias Gebauer, the security correspondent for the influential weekly Der Spiegel, said the European approach had been to “shower Trump with praise and deference and try to teach him a little about how to seal a peace deal”. “The best-case scenario as seen in Berlin would be the Europeans convincing Trump not to act hastily” and to keep up the pressure on Moscow, he said. “But everyone knows that chances aren’t very good. Trump is very impatient when it comes to Ukraine, and he cares much less about European interests than he does about the prospect of a quick deal with Putin.”"
world/2025/oct/15/raila-odinga-former-kenya-pm-dies,"Raila Odinga, towering Kenyan opposition figure, dies aged 80",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/raila-odinga-former-kenya-pm-dies,World news,2025-10-15T13:28:49Z,"The veteran Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, who ran five times for the presidency and had a profound influence on the country’s politics, has died aged 80 in India. Odinga was in the southern city of Kochi for treatment. The Press Trust of India news agency reported that he had a cardiac arrest during a morning walk. In an address to the nation on Wednesday, Kenya’s president, William Ruto, described Odinga as “a once-in-a-generation leader”, “a giant of democracy” and “a tireless warrior of good governance”. He said: “In his passing, we have lost a patriot of uncommon courage, a pan-Africanist, a unifier who sought peace and unity above power and self-gain, an unceasing servant of the people who gave his all for the promise of a better Kenya.” Ruto declared seven national days of mourning and said Odinga would be accorded a state funeral. An enduring opposition figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga became an MP in 1992 and his most recent run for the presidency was in 2022. His narrow loss to Mwai Kibaki in the disputed 2007 election triggered unrest that killed about 1,300 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. He became prime minister in 2008 in a national unity government headed by Kibaki as part of a deal to end the bloodshed. In 1982, Odinga, a son of Kenya’s first vice-president, Oginga Odinga, was charged with treason in connection with a coup against the then president, Daniel arap Moi, and detained without trial for six years. An ardent political activist, he was arrested many times during Moi’s administration for fighting against his one-party rule. His fight for democracy helped the country achieve two milestone political reforms: changing to a multiparty democracy in 1991, and enacting a new constitution in 2010. Ruto said in his address: “For decades, Raila dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice, equity, and freedom. He endured detention and persecution so that this nation might know and enjoy democracy.” A hugely popular figure, Odinga was able to mobilise massive crowds to attend his rallies, and supporters called him Baba – “father” in Swahili. As news of his death reached the streets, hundreds of supporters from the Nairobi neighbourhood of Kibera, where he was MP, made their way in a procession to his home in the Karen neighbourhood. In reaction to youth-led anti-government protests last year, he entered an agreement with the president, William Ruto, under which his Orange Democratic Movement party became part of a “broad-based government” and gained a role in policymaking. Tributes have poured in for the former prime minister. The former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta said: “We have lost a father to the nation, a steadfast champion for the people, and a true son of Kenya. His legacy is not just in the political battles he fought, but in the peace he helped build. It is etched in the very fabric of our nation.” The former chief justice and current presidential aspirant David Maraga said he was shocked by news of Odinga’s death. He described him as “a patriot, a pan-Africanist, a democrat and a leader who made significant contributions to democracy in Kenya and in Africa”. “Kenya has lost one of its most formidable leaders who shaped the trajectory of our beloved country. Africa has lost a leading voice in pushing for peace, security and development. The world has lost a great leader,” he said. Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chair of the African Union Commission, said Odinga was “a steadfast champion of democracy, good governance, and people-centred development”. He said: “His decades-long commitment to justice, pluralism, and democratic reform left an indelible mark not only on Kenya but across the African continent.” The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said Odinga was a “towering statesman”. Condolences were also offered by Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, and the Tanzanian president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, who described Odinga’s death as a tragedy “not just for Kenya, but for all of us”. • This article was amended on 16 October 2025. Raila Odinga became an MP in 1992, not 2002."
world/2025/sep/17/south-africa-dance-choreographer-lee-che-janecke-amapiano-afrobeats-tyla,‘A dance done by the whole world’: South African choreographer dreams of global reach,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/south-africa-dance-choreographer-lee-che-janecke-amapiano-afrobeats-tyla,World news,2025-09-17T04:00:26Z,"In a dance studio in suburban east Johannesburg, the choreographer Lee-ché Janecke put a group of student cheerleaders through their steps. After five hours of everything from body rolls to voguing with pompoms and a classic cheerleading lift, the excited group gathered round Janecke to make a TikTok of one of the latest South African amapiano dance challenges. They were done in just two takes. Janecke has been at the forefront of the growing global popularity of South African dance and music in the past few years. Having worked with Tyla since she was 17, he was responsible for the viral dance that accompanied Water, the breakout hit that propelled the now 23-year-old South African singer and songwriter to worldwide fame. Janecke now wants to turn his own growing reputation into a global brand, moving beyond the South African music industry while still retaining the essence of his culture. “When I speak about my life it makes me emotional to know this is where it’s come to, and that where it’s come to feels like a new start,” he said, after finishing the day’s rehearsal. Janecke grew up in Bonteheuwel in Cape Town and then Eldorado Park in Johannesburg, both historically “Coloured” townships. He heard his grandpa playing Madonna and Michael Jackson, and would dance at family events. He initially planned to study accounting after school, but was unable to resist the pull of dance, in which he has never been formally trained. By 2011, Janecke was exploring femininity in dance and accepted himself as gay. He co-founded V.I.N.T.A.G.E, South Africa’s first male dance crew focused on vogueing and whacking, styles that originated in New York’s ballroom scene in the late 1980s and 1990s. The crew, which expanded to include women and a fashion stylist, participated in numerous televised dance competitions. However, it came second in all but the last one it entered, something Janecke blamed on South Africa not yet being ready for the openly LGBTQ+ dancers. In 2013, the group was attacked at a minibus taxi rank as they travelled back from performing at Soweto Pride. A mob surrounded their taxi, yelling and rocking the vehicle from side to side, until the conductor finally persuaded them to disperse. “It gave: ‘Yeah girl, this is the end for you,’” recalled Janecke. By 2015, V.I.N.T.A.G.E had disbanded, as Janecke started getting booked alone, choreographing the talent show Idols South Africa for six years. He was hired by Tyla’s first manager to train her. “I [felt]: ‘There’s something about this girl.’ I can see it in their eyes,” he said. Fast-forward to 2025 and the rehearsal with the cheerleaders – two university squads opening a Red Bull half-court basketball tournament with numbers choreographed by Janecke – was just a few days after the MTV Video Music Awards. Tyla took home Best Afrobeats for Push2Start. The video was choreographed by Janecke, who was also nominated for best choreography. This was the pinnacle of more than two years of working with Tyla internationally on everything from The Voice finale to the BET Awards and Coachella. Janecke also choreographed US and UK shows for the DJ Uncle Waffles and taught amapiano classes at Ailey Extension, the studio of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater company in New York, and at Playground in LA. “For me, the end of that chapter is the VMA nomination,” Janecke said. He was on set when he found out he had been nominated: “I immediately burst into tears. I was so emotional, I think I still get emotional, because … I sat up, 3am, to watch the VMAs live. I always knew that this is where my destiny lies.” Janecke gesticulated as he spoke, getting up to demonstrate dance moves. “I have to take the right steps to continue expressing and getting this brand out there, away from the names attached to it.” He listed his ambitions – getting a US agent, working with everyone from Dua Lipa and Doechii to Beyoncé and Madonna, and breaking into the K-pop market, advertising and musicals. He cited Robbie Blue, who choreographed Gap’s autumn 2025 advert with the girl band Katseye and won the 2025 choreography VMA for Doechii’s Anxiety video, as being at the level he believes he is capable of achieving. Nonetheless, Janecke was emphatic he would keep working with Tyla: “That’s my girl for life … She’s very passionate about creating music and really changing the dynamic and the conversation of the world.” While Janecke expressed frustration that South Africa lacked the intentional and seamless working environment of the US, he said he remained South African to his core. “My African dream got a dance done by the whole world … so, for me, Lee-ché’s dream is an African dream.”"
world/2025/jun/17/the-netherlands-world-leading-postnatal-care-facing-crisis-unions-warn,"The Netherlands’ world-leading postnatal care facing crisis, unions warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/the-netherlands-world-leading-postnatal-care-facing-crisis-unions-warn,World news,2025-06-17T04:00:39Z,"A key pillar of Dutch maternity services that has led to the Netherlands being hailed as a world leader in postnatal care is under threat, healthcare unions in the country have warned. The Netherlands has long prided itself on its unique system of kraamzorg (maternity care), whereby a maternity care assistant comes to a new family’s home for eight days after a baby’s birth, caring for mother and infant. But on Tuesday, five healthcare unions are expected to present a manifesto and petition of almost 15,000 signatures to MPs in The Hague, warning that a shortage of labour and competition from other care jobs have left the system facing crisis. The petition calls for a guarantee of the future of good kraamzorg for all mothers and newborns in the Netherlands. The unions want a dedicated ministerial representative and better pay, including for “waiting” time, where care workers have to be available in case babies are born but receive about €11.50 (£9.80) for an eight-hour shift, before tax. A typical contract of 130 hours a month includes 244 to 265 hours on standby, according to the FNV trade union. “Last year there were 500 families without a maternity care assistant,” said Daniëlle Verveen, a care assistant from Krommenie, near Amsterdam. “And the expectation is that this will increase up to 2034, in just 10 years, to 37,000 families without kraamzorg.” Marloes Kortland, from the CNV union, said the kraamzorg system of supporting new parents, checking babies’ health and helping with tricky newborn challenges such as breastfeeding was a one-off and deserved to be preserved. “The Netherlands is the only country that has this care,” she said. “In the countries around us, women stay for much longer in hospital but here, the care for mother and children is taken up straight away by the maternity care assistants. “But the problem is that there is a shortage of care assistants, the work pressure is ever greater and more people are leaving. “Kraamzorg demands a lot of flexibility from people because you never know when a baby will be born … and if you have a family yourself, it is very difficult to combine the two.” Almost one in seven babies are born at home in the Netherlands and, at such a birth, the assistant is present alongside a midwife. In a hospital or maternity unit birth, women are typically discharged within hours and the care worker then visits every day to monitor mother and baby. The system, mostly paid for through health insurance, offers between 24 and 80 hours of care. But in periods such as the summer holiday it is creaking at the seams, said GreenLeft MP and former midwife Elke Slagt-Tichelman. “If there’s a peak with births in a region, it can be exhausting for the maternity care assistants to get the schedule organised, and sometimes parents get less assistance,” she said. Although vital, she added, the job of maternity care assistant was challenging and “not attractive” from a remunerative point of view. “Like taking care of the elderly, it is a really underpaid job,” she said. But Verveen – who said that in three years she had saved a 24-hour-old girl from choking and helped 200 families – said the profession had a value far beyond income. “There is something magical about life as a maternity carer,” she said. “You help a family start up a new life.”"
world/2025/aug/26/france-political-crisis-francois-bayrou-prime-minister,France faces new political crisis as PM expected to lose confidence vote,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/france-political-crisis-francois-bayrou-prime-minister,World news,2025-08-26T18:04:12Z,"France is braced for another political crisis as the minority government of François Bayrou appears almost certain to be toppled in a confidence vote next month, amid deep political divisions over an unpopular austerity budget and debt-reduction plan. “I will fight like a dog,” the centrist prime minister told L’Express on Tuesday after his surprise decision to call a vote of confidence from parliamentarians. Bayrou, 74, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, is expected to lose the vote as opposition parties on the far right and left said they would relish the opportunity to eject him after less than nine months in office. Boris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist parliamentary group, told BFM TV: “We need to change politics and for that we need to change prime minister.” Bayrou’s gamble – which involves Macron convening a special session of parliament on 8 September for a confidence vote that the prime minister has almost no chance of winning – has sparked fears of another political crisis less than a year after the previous government of Michel Barnier was toppled over budget disagreements after only three months. The Paris stock market tumbled, shares in French banks sank and the country’s borrowing costs rose on Tuesday as investors fretted. A planned protest movement against Bayrou’s proposed budget cuts, which gathered support on social media over the summer, as well as potential strikes and demonstrations by trade unions are expected to begin on 10 September, regardless of whether Bayrou is forced to quit. The beleaguered politician attended a meeting of the CFDT trade union on Tuesday where he urged French political parties to think carefully about the vote, noting they had 13 days to “say whether they are on the side of chaos or responsibility”. Bayrou said: “Is there or is there not a national emergency to rebalance the accounts, to escape excessive debt by choosing to reduce our deficits and produce more? That is the central question.” In what was seen as a last-minute appeal to the left, he said he was prepared to demand a “specific effort” from high-wealth individuals, after his budget proposals were widely criticised for affecting poor people and pensioners while having less impact on the very wealthy. If Bayrou is ousted, Macron would be dragged into domestic upheaval at a significant international moment for him, as he positions himself to play a role on Ukraine and the recognition of a Palestinian state. Under the French political system, the president, who is head of state and has authority on foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister as head of government to run domestic affairs. Macron could swiftly appoint a new prime minister but they too could risk being ousted over the budget. A source close to the far-right leader Marine Le Pen told Reuters it was hard to see how any new prime minister could escape being hit by a vote of no confidence. Le Pen’s party instead wants Macron to dissolve parliament and call a snap election. Macron said this summer he did not want to do this, but the justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said on Tuesday that an election could not be ruled out. Since Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A left alliance took the largest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron’s centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical voting from the left and centre. The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left. The interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, who leads the rightwing Les Républicains party that has propped up Bayrou, said it would be irresponsible and “against France’s interests” to vote for the government to fall. At the heart of the crisis is Bayrou’s unpopular and vague plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt. This includes scrapping two public holidays and freezing welfare spending and tax brackets. Hospital staff are concerned about deep cuts to the public health service. Polls show voters on all political sides see the budget as unfair and letting the wealthiest off the hook. This summer, Bayrou became the least popular French prime minister since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958, with one poll showing 80% of French people did not trust him. • This article was amended on 27 August 2025. The left alliance took the largest number of seats in the 2024 French legislative election, not the most votes as an earlier version said."
